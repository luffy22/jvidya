(1, 80, 'Surya', 'surya', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sun popularly known as Surya in Vedic Astrology is the king of all planets. It is the karaka for soul which is considered a part of God or God itselt. Not only that Surya is responsible for health, fame and leadership roles. Surya is also a karaka for father. Our eyes which let us see this beautiful world are governed by Surya as well. It is a male planet, royalty in nature and is given the title of King among planets.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Surya is the king and leadership skills come naturally to those with good placement for Surya, ideally the 10th house. Many great politicians and leaders have Surya in an important placement in the horoscope. People with positive Surya in a horoscope show poise, confidence and firm determination. They rise to the status of a leader and an able administrator. People with a good Surya can be quite successful in the areas of agriculture and administration. Goverment jobs which provide a sense of security and stability are very likely due to a good Surya in a horoscope. Even if Surya is in <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28:tula&amp;catid=11:12-signs&amp;Itemid=111">libra</a> which is its neecha rashi, provided it causes a neecha bhanga you are sure to see the concerned individual in a very important administrative or political role. Bear in mind they rarely get the top position if Surya is indeed in libra. Health, Vigour and Vitality all improve if Surya is in a good placement in a horoscope. With Budh as a co-tenant in a good sign or house, a very powerful yoga called Budh-Adidya Yoga is formed. It provides wealth, fame and prosperity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are downsides to any planet and Surya is no different. While a positive sun is a boon for individuals it is a curse for those around him. Surya is arrogant and inconsiderate to other people''s needs. In popular stories Surya is the father and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a> is the son yet they both don''t get along well. This is partly down to the autocratic and dictatorial nature of Surya the father and unapologetic and rigid nature of Shani the son. Families where father and children don''t get along well are sure to have Surya-Shani relationship in one way or the other. Surya influenced people generally get high positions and they are sure to push everyone to work beyond their possible limit which maybe fortunate for the enterprises but not so fortunate for the employees. Well surely they don''t become Mr. Popular with the minions yet they are sure to get special accolades from their bosses. In terms of health a bad placement of Surya is sure to give you several ailments, weak body and low confidence but a strong placement gives over-confidence in ones abilities and ultimately that causes their downfall. Burns and Boils also happen if Surya is in a fiery sign.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The problem with people who have a good Surya is they act confident and ambitious and shine a little too much for others to feel jealousy and insecurity. People often confuse their confidence for arrogance and their ambitions for egocentric behavior. They do not help their own cause either by being insensitive to those less confident and successful souls. &nbsp;Not everyone can become successful in life cause if everyone becomes a king then who will be the subjects? This trivial matter is too hard for people with good placement of Surya to understand. While the benefits of a good Surya are great as it gives authority, fame and health one must care not to be over-confident and forget kindness and empathy.</p>', '', 1, 10, '2014-02-01 11:43:52', 899, '', '2014-03-06 06:53:36', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 11:43:52', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 3, 9, 'surya in astrology, surya in vedic astrology, surya in 12 rashi, surya in 12 bhava', 'Surya in Vedic Astrology', 1, 14, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(2, 82, 'Chandra', 'chandra', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moon popularly known as Chandra in Vedic Astrology is the planet of affections and emotions. It is a karaka for mind and everything related to it. Moon also affects the blood circulation as well as water portions on the body and on earth. Well that implies nearly 70% of body and of earth are affected by Chandra. Chandra maybe a small planet and it only stays in a rashi for 2.5 days but its implications are huge when you take the co-tenants, rashi and house lords into consideration. Chandra brings tides and ebbs in an ocean and similarly it brings tides and ebbs in a human mind also. Every positive or negative, good or evil, happy or sad, nice or bad thought that comes to an individual is thanks to chandra and associations and afflictions to chandra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moon is the closest planet to the earth. Theoretically it is a satellite. Just like satellites are responsible for good and bad signals in a television; Chandra is responsible for good and bad thoughts in an individual. <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu</a> association with Chandra is a prime factor for people with weak or malefic thought process. Of course the rashi occupied by Chandra also plays an important role in shaping the thought process of an individual. Generally speaking association of Chandra to Shani, Rahu, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Mangal</a>, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4:buddh&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Budh</a>, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:surya&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Surya</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9:ketu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Ketu</a> is considered bad. Though bear in mind it is not always the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is highly impressionable graha. It quickly takes in the qualities of its rashi, co-tenants and grahas which aspect it.&nbsp;Lets talk in more detail about Chandra and associations with other planets.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Surya is called as Amavasya or No Moon. Many astrologers and jyotishis push the panic button once they hear of this scenario. Various havans, poojas and rings are provided to calm these so called horrible scenario. Well the truth couldn''t be farther off. Well Surya is soul and Chandra is the mind and it wouldn''t be so bad if soul and mind become one considering that soul is considered part of god and mind is the most definiting part in an invidual.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Mangal is considered auspicious by many astrologers cause it gives abundant wealth. That is partly true but they forget to mention that this association gives rise to a wounded warrior who is always there to take revenge on others.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Budh is probably among the worst. Most mental disorders are caused by this association. Chandra controls the mind while Budh takes care of nervous system. Not to mention this association causes an individual to be a chatter box.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association to Guru is probably the best. In a favourable rashi it causes a powerful yoga called Gaja Kesari yoga. It gives abundant wealth, happiness and prosperity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Shukra is also good. It provides abundant love. Most of the romeo-juliet stories are thanks to Chandra-Shukra association. The fairest and most beautiful looking individuals both male and female are very likely to have assocation of Chandra with Shukra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Shani causes Vish Yoga. The mind is constantly in thinking process and nothing comes out of tireless thinking but sadness and worries. Depression is one of the possible scenarious with Shani-Chandra association. But people who learn to control their emotions and adapt to difficulties and changing scenarios become great individuals but that doesn''t come without a struggle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra with Rahu is bad in general terms. Rahu is cloudy and smokey and causes disruption to natural though process. Simply speaking this association clouds judgement of an individual.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Ketu is bad for some and good for some. Ketu is the planet of detachment. Well for those who want to get closer to the god; this placement provides the right tools of obtaining that goal. For those who are too caught up with materialistic success; consider this placement to quite a bother and probably arrange for some counter measures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is very small but its implications on human beings are pretty big. It alone is a gentle, calm and caring graha but depending on rashi lordship or co-tenants it could bring peace or havoc in your life. The greatest enemy or friend of an individual is not anyone but his mind and thoughts. Once you control your own mind; controlling this world is not that difficult.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 10, '2014-02-01 11:44:20', 899, '', '2014-03-19 07:48:24', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 11:44:20', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 5, 8, 'chandra in vedic astrology, chandra in astrology, chandra in 12 bhava, chandra in 12 rashi', 'chandra in vedic astrology', 1, 18, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(3, 84, 'Mangal', 'mangal', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mars popularly known as Mangal is another planet along with Shani who invokes fear in the minds of people especially for those who are of the age where marriage takes priority. A Mangal Dosha is a tragedy for the bride/groom and their parents yet a boon for the astrologers. No one is bothered to know that the very word "Mangal" means good and auspicious. Ofcourse mars is a fiery planet and has his sort of problems associated with itself but it is better to understand why this fiery planet is so angry and cold before making any judgement on people who are influenced very highly by this planet.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal is considered a male planet. To be more precise people born under the infuence of mars are the macho types. These includes females also. The ladies who like to order, shout and get angry to get things done are mostly under the influence of a strong mars in horoscope. Mars has a lot of high octane energy. People under the influence of Mars keep on doing relentless work, want everything on time, get angry at smallest inaccuracies of co-workers or employees and worst of all keep others on their toes. Mars hates laziness and lies. These are the reasons why they are the ideal employees but not-so great employers. Mangal is least likely to cause downfall of others. They may get angry, make enemies, use harsh speech but they rarely ever keep enemity for lives. They may get angry very fast but their anger also calms down after some time. But none the less Mangal does have its share of handicaps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mangal is impatient and very harsh in speech. People under influence of Mars often make rash decisions and make enemies out of people due to their high moral values and principles. The world is not so honest and sincere. It is full of scums and leeches who thrive on looting and cheating others. Since Mangal cannot stand these things he is always at logger-heads with these people. A bride or groom who has Mangal in a prominent position cannot compromise on his/her ideals and principles. That is why a lot of quarrels happen and eventually divorces happen. Ofcourse astrologers do not help the cause by matching partners with Mars or <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a>&nbsp;in a prominent position of the partner.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; None the less Mars does have its good side. Mars influence people easily sacrifice their own goodwill for people for whom they care. They would give up their profit for others to avoid loss. If any sort of association with Jupiter is present they could even bear loss if those they care for are profited from their sacrifice.&nbsp;Most of the prominent actors, sportsperson, celebrities and good army commanders have Mars in a very good position. Mars influence people do great in places where everything needs to be done on time like railways and armies. They make very competent lawyers and deal makers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; In my view some people are born for the benefit of the community. They are there to make a difference. Mars influenced people are one of them. They may not be the most charming people to stay around but they are the most trustworthy, hard working and kind hearted people to be friends with.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 10, '2014-02-01 11:45:23', 899, '', '2014-03-06 07:59:59', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 11:45:23', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 3, 7, 'mangal in vedic astrology, mangal in 12 rashi, mangal in 12 bhava, mangal dosha, mangal in astrology, mars in astrology', 'mangal in vedic astrology', 1, 5, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(4, 86, 'Budh', 'budh', '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercury known as Budh in Vedic Astrology is the prince among planets. Budh is young, talkative and smart. Budh is generally very close to Surya in a horoscope with maximum distance being 28 degrees from each other. Budh provides common sense, speech, communicative skills and also commands the neural processes in the brain. Budh and Guru are almost identical in that both are scholars but in present scenarios the smart and argumentative Budh wins over the knowledgable but dignified Guru. Budh takes the qualities of its co-tenants easily be it good or bad. It is a very impressionable graha. Though Budh doesn''t see most planets as enemies other then Chandra, many see him as their enemy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this age of PR those who can market themselves get more brownie points over others. Thanks to Budh you can effectively communicate your point across to others be it via speech or via writing. Most of the scientific research and innovations are possible due to the ideas and itellact provided by Budh. Be warned that plain old Budh is nothing but sweet talk. It needs a driver to put argument into efforts and theories into practise. Grahas like Mangal, Shani and Surya''s association with Budh are the drivers behind most important inventions. Budh is a businessman or more precisely a sales man. He can sweet talk anybody into buying a product be it good or bad. Most effecient salesman, call centre operatives, shop keepers and marketers need a good Budh for success in their fields. Those who have a weak Budh may suffer from speech defects, bad communicative skills as well as mental disorders.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budh is a very impressionable graha. Like Chandra it takes the qualities of its rashi, house and co-tenants very easily. A plain old Budh rarely makes or breaks a person. With planet Surya as its co-tenant a very powerful yoga is formed known as Budh-Aditya yoga which provides knowledge, wealth and heppiness. Though not everyone gets the benefit of Budh-Aditya yoga. Association of Budh+Mangal is difficult to judge. Sometimes this association causes catostrophe because Budh is calm while Mangal is restless. Two opposing forces staying in a rashi would provide disaster. But there are times when Budh provides direction to the abundant energy of Mangal. Many great individuals have a favorable association of Budh+Mangal. Many successful lawyers have Budh+Mangal relationship in their horoscope. Budh+Guru is a favorable association by and large. Guru''s knowledge is supported by Budh''s analytical, communicative and argumentative skills. In not so favourable location you could see a thug who uses his knowledge and speech to cheat others. Either way you are guaranteed to see a smart and successful individual when Budh+Guru is there in a horoscope. Budh+Shukra is also a very good combination.

(5, 88, 'Guru', 'guru', '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an astrologer starts to read a horoscope the two things he is going to definitely check for is position of <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Saturn</a> for bad results and Jupiter for good results. Jupiter is the most benefic planet in a horoscope. Popularly known as guru, it is considered a karaka for wealth, happines and well being. A well placed guru in a horoscope suggests a successful and happy life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jupiter is one planet which alone in a good position can liberate from all other negative influence of planets. It gives a positive outlook in life, gives a calm personality and pleasing appearance. A strong guru signifies a person who is learned, smart, calm and dignified. Guru gives a firm and unwavering faith in god and provides knowledge of Truth. Knowledge alone can free a soul from the worldy chains that plague the human soul and takes the soul closer to its maker aka The God.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jupiter maybe the most benefic planet in a horoscope but it does have its share of negative influence like any other planet. People with Guru in a prominent position often are a bit chubby. Guru promotes well being but unfortunately it promotes laziness and gluttony also. Guru cause a person to be fat, chubby and easy going. When there is a crisis at work they maybe the calmest persons in the office but they will leave the proactive work to people with strong <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Mangal</a>. They are the ideal employers and marriage partners but not the most ideal employees. They rarely take up challenges which require them to sweat and they rarely have to drop a sweat to achieve something in life. Connection or Co-tenants like <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4:buddh&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Budha</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6:shukra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shukra</a> can cause all hell to break loose. Such people will go to any lenghts to make their pockets bigger and others people''s pockets smaller.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All said and done, the benefits of Guru far outweigh its drawbacks. People with a strong guru are kind in nature and wonderful friends and family members. They easily get help from all spheres of life. People who crave for an easy lifestyle should definitely hope for a well placed Guru.

(6, 90, 'Shukra', 'shukra', '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you think of romance and pleasures there is only one planet that can satisfy your quench for them. The name is Venus. Popularly known as Shukra in Vedic Astrology, shukra is the planet of pleasures, luxuries and music. It is identical to <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a> as it gives abundant wealth but Shukra also gives pleasures and luxuries. While it does not have the humility to handle fame or wealth, it is guaranteed that a person with prominent Shukra would have lived his/her life to the fullest and given pleasure to all of his/her sensual organs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shukra is the kamdeva personified. All the romance in the world is a gift from Shukra. The beautiful women, melodious music and mesmerizing dance moves are all thanks to the great planet called Shukra. The life force or semen which brings another life on this earth is also governed by Shukra. All the sexual organs which provide pleasures are governed by Shukra. The delicacies like Chocolate and Pastries derive their sweetness from Shukra as Shukra is the karaka for Sweetness. The people with a great disposition of Shukra are attractive, wealthy, fashionable and charming. They are admirers of art, music, fashion and beauty.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Shukra is a karaka for everything beautiful and gorgeous it does have its downsides. Shukra promotes excessive sweetness and drug addiction. It does not know any limits to pleasures and romance. Most of the taboo activities are carried on when a person is either under the influence of Shukra or with association to Mangal and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu</a>. With <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Mangal</a> as a co-tenant or mutual aspect you could find a flirt and even a womaniser. All the marriages done on whims and instant attraction are due to Shukra-Mangal connections. When there is Rahu involved with Shukra marriage may even be with the wrong person and leads to bad reputation for the individual and their close relatives. Shukra causes drug, alcohol and sex addiction. Even addiction to medicines and prescribed drugs is possible with bad placement of Shukra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that it does do wonderful with <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a> as co-tenant. The individual with Shukra+Chandra as co-tenant could have a romantic equation of epic proportions on par with Romeo-Juliet or Heer-Ranjhaana and remain inseparable throughout life. Shukra with Guru as co-tenant may give wealth, happiness and knowledge but many a times it is through illegal means. Shukra with Shani is quite bad as Shani''s negativity is a damp squid for sensual and pleasurable Shukra. But since both planets are friendly it rarely causes destruction. An aspect of Shani or Guru on Shukra is quite a blessing to have. Shukra also gives love for animals and provides benefits through them in a favourable placement.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most beautiful woman and fortunate man have Shukra in a very good disposition. All the famous celebrities have a good Shukra or a favourable period of good Shukra. While Guru may give wealth, happiness and knowledge to a native leave it to Shukra to give you the finer things in life. Shukra natives are like a horse wihout a lease which can run off anywhere he/she pleases. The kind of ecstacy, pleasures and forbidden desires which Shukra provides can only be dreamt by other planets. Fame and fortune is abundant for people with a good Shukra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ofcourse with no boundary between acceptance and taboo most of the Shukra influenced people go bonkers after a certain time start resorting to drugs or even medicines to calm their mind. Romance and Sensual pleasures could be over the top but so is the risk of catching a venereal disease. Love takes a backseat and lust would control your mind and body unless there is a limiting aspect of Guru or Shani involved. The price of being a celebrityy is high with no privacy or peace but those who only crave for Page 3 lifestyle should start pleasing dear sweet aunty known as Shukra. For people with problematic Shukra praying to Lord Krishna or Goddess Laxmi for improving the condition and Goddess Santoshi Maa for decreasing the side-effects of afflicted Shukra is highly beneficial.</p>', '', 1, 10, '2014-02-01 11:46:57', 899, '', '2014-03-06 08:07:23', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 11:46:57', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 3, 4, 'shukra in vedic astrology, shukra in astrology, shukra in 12 bhavas, shukra in 12 rashi, shukra in astrology', 'shukra in vedic astrology', 1, 4, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(7, 92, 'Shani', 'shani', '<ul class="nav nav-tabs">\r\n<li class="active"><a href="#">Shani</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79:shani-superstition&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani &amp; Superstition</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word Shani seems to invoke fear in the hearts of people like no other planet. Shani represents scarcity, fear, oppression, old age and poverty. Well that alone seems to put this humble planet in the category of worst of the worst. By all means Shani can be said to be a malefic planet who brings adversities and havoc in our lives but the perspective has to change regarding how we look at adversities to understand the working of Shani a little more.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start by saying that Shani is appointed as a judge by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/shiva.htm">Lord Shiva</a> himself. A normal judiciary functions according to laws of the country and Shani functions according to divine laws of the nature. Shani is aware of most of our karmas and he provides punishments befitting our crimes. Most of the human beings are far from noble souls. We lie, steal, ridicule others and even deceive or backstab others. This is not limited to one birth time but continues over several births and rebirths. Though we may not be aware of these crimes, gramps Shani keeps a watchful eye over these karmas. Remember, he cannot punish you unless you have done some crime. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why the fear of gramps Shani? Well, we are human beings after all. We cannot fathom why we need patience, hard work and discipline while the other guy gets the ferraris, the beautiful mansions and the iPhones. The sooner we learn the need for discipline, hard work, patience, fortitude and empathy the sooner does gramps Shani move out of our way. He does give wonderful results to those who plan the long road to success with honest and sincere efforts and plan betterment of the community and world. But those good fruits take a long, long time to come. By that time your patience is tested to the limits and your ego and arrogance is washed away. You are new and renewed all dignified, kind and considerate to your fellow beings. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is gramps Shani good or bad? Well he is bad cause we often plan shortcuts in life and easy way out of misery and suffering. That is the sole reason why Shani makes our lives a miserable hell. Say you are a prisoner in a jail and the warden catches you &nbsp;trying to sneak out of jail before your sentence is over. Most of us would assume that the warden would be very upset and may sentence us to more severe punishment. Same thing applies to Shani but he actually cares for his prisoners and wants them to be contributing members of the society. We do not like Shani cause he is a strict teacher who likes to whip now and then to teach some discipline and hard work to his students. No one likes to learn the things the hard way so to speak.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said all this Shani has positive aspects in life also. Most of the guys who grow from rags to riches have Shani in an important disposition in their horoscope. Most of the people who make a difference in lives of others have Shani in exalted or own sign or in a good position. Shani destroys everything that is not sustainable over a long period of time. That includes relationships. Most of the divorces happen during the Saade-Saati or Shani Periods. Though it may seem like hell at that time after some time we come to realise that the relationship couldn''t have worked out and what happened was for the better. Our ego is destroyed and we learn the importance of patience and dignity. At the end of saade-saati most people develop a positive outlook towards lives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day it all comes down to perspective. A simple, easy-going life is a choice of most but attainable by few. Those who believe in making lemonade, when lemons are provided fare much better in life then those who cry while looking at the lemons. Success is not defined by how high a person rises but how many times a person gets up after falling.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 10, '2014-02-01 11:47:34', 899, '', '2014-03-06 08:10:11', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 11:47:34', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 4, 3, 'shani in vedic astrology, shani in astrology, shani in 12 bhava, shani in 12 rashi, saade-saati, shani and superstition', 'shani in vedic astrology', 1, 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(8, 94, 'Rahu', 'rahu', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rahu is a shadow planet and is considered the north node of the moon. It is also termed as a dragon''s head in some places while in vedic astrology Rahu has the head of a snake. According to vedic astrology, Rahu is responsible for causing eclipse to Sun and the Moon. Rahu is &nbsp;smokey and mysterious. He represents black arts, magic, taboo activities and foreigners. Rahu is an impersonator who tries to show the qualities he does not have. He is considered a malefic planet and astrologers make quite a fortune out of the so-called bad yogas associated with it. Well, the truth couldn''t be further off.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rahu is a planet in vedic astrology and like in all planet''s case certain rules and regulations apply. The placement of Rahu at time of birth is fixed according to previous life karmas. Rahu is the most accurate measure to judge the sins of previous life karmas depending on his placement in horoscope along with its drishti. Rahu carries the mandate of putting a human being under illusion. Rahu encourages individuals to take risky and foolish decisions which only bring harm and loss for him. Ofcourse, sometimes it gives quite favorable results for people interested in forbidden desires and&nbsp;taboo activites. Not only that money, power, sex and fame are also abundant in a favorable period of Rahu.&nbsp;Most politicians have a very good Rahu. Rahu is a karaka for foreigners and everything mysterious. Rahu is one of the planets which in a favorable position can suggest a successful chance of going and settling abroad. Rahu in 4th house, 9th house and 12th house suggests if individual will live and stay away from home and in foreign locations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rahu magnifies the bad effects and lessens the good effects of planet which is its co-tenant. It is generally favorable if Rahu is alone in a house with no co-tenants and not casting drishti on any planet. Rahu causes eclipse to the Sun and the Moon. In other words the intelligence and rational thinking are hindered due to Rahu. Bad decisions, tough luck and mental problems follow. The individuals who have <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:surya&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Surya</a>+Rahu or <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a>+Rahu in the same house are better off when they consult others for major decisions in their lives. Rahu+<a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Mangal</a> is not as bad but cause relationships with siblings to go sour and also promotes anger, restlessness along with frustrations at not getting things done on time. Rahu+<a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a> is famously known as Viprachandal Yoga.

(9, 96, 'Ketu', 'ketu', '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ketu is another shadowy planet like <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu</a> which features prominently in Indian Astrology.

It is a malefic planet but that does mean it is literally bad. The facts about Ketu are often misinterpreted to suit the worldy desires so much so that it has lost its divine purpose. Ketu is capable of taking an individual closer to moksha. Only <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a> is the other planet which can boasts of this great feat. The final purpose of all living beings is to get closer to the Supreme Entity aka God.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why the unnecessary prejudice towards Ketu? Well the fact that Ketu has its own agenda which is free from the social norms, rules and regulations makes it quite a villian for the society. The world is not known to welcome people who go against social norms. Most of people with Ketu in lagna or with <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a> in horoscope are detached from others and live a solitary life. They have a nihilistic, uncaring and unapologetic attitude towards society as a whole. They are meant to break away from the social bonds which bind the individuals to society. Some of them even resort to total reclusiveness from society in the form of Sanyas. Others less fortunate try to live a detached life while remaining in the society constantly at logger-heads with the cultural norms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets talk of the downside of Ketu in a bad placement for a bit. Ketu is the astrological equivalent word of detachment. Divorces, Separation from loved ones and Solitary Life would send quivers down anyone''s spine. As long as you live in this world ones self is bound to have inclinations towards socialisation, recognition, acceptence, affection and attraction. It is only natural to have these feelings. The greatest of the saints and holy souls desired for such comforts and pleasures. Now the person who lived in solitary confinement and emotional reclusiveness cannot just mix with the society like sugar in water. They would always stick out like a sore thumb. Eventually their desires fade away and they become even more reclusive and paranoid of the society. They loose purpose and motivation in their life. But fear not as Krishna said in the Gita:</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">"<em>One who walks on path towards knowledge and engages in auspicious activities does not meet his end.</em>" --Bhagvad Gita Chapter 6 Verse 40</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence here is person with a good Ketu is naturally detached and not interested in materialistic goals and social confirmity.

In simpler terms the First House in a horoscope is the mirror to the individual whose horoscope is shown. The important thing to know is only a summary is possible through First House. The whole thesis of an individual requires lots of careful study of various factors including Chandra Lagna, Surya Lagna, Nakshatra Lords of Lagna and Chandra and last by not least the Lagnesha.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1st house ispart of Vishnu Sthanas as well as trine called Laxmi Sthanas. The physical attributes and complexion of individuals are based on rashi in lagna, lagnesha and also the nakshatra lords of lagna and lagnesha. The emotional characteristics of individual can be more accurately predicted using lagna, lagnesha and Chandra''s placement in horoscope and nakshatra lord of <a href="option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a>.

First House and lagnesha are also important factors to be considered to view health. Emotional picture of individual is better estimated from Chandra Lagna. Same way Surya Lagna is used to decipher the spiritual view of things.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each lagna/first house has a planetary lord which is known as lagnesha. The placement of lagnesha is also very important to be considered when talking about charecteristics, health, emotions and physical attributes. A troubled placement of lagnesha suggests a troubled individual while a favourable placement of lagnesha suggests success and happiness for individual. Whatever the result one could find his true self through First House and Lagnesha. The rashi charecteristics are also absorbed by First House. Say a Cancer in Lagna/First House at time of birth suggest a kind and caring person. His complexion is generally fairer compared to those around him.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ever find the need to discover youself using astrology then first house is a nice place to start. It provides a brief overview of you as a person. If you carefully study First House including Chandra Lagna, Surya Lagna, Nakshatra Lord of Lagna and Lagnesha as well as Rashi in First House you could solve the big jigsaw puzzle that is your characture and nature.

For example <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6:shukra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shukra</a> in 6th house gives high probability for diabetes, drug-addiction and also increases the chances of sexually transmitted diseases. <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a> gives obesity and gluttony. <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4:buddh&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Budh</a> make up for a weak mind and nervous disorders. <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:surya&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Surya</a> gives boils and all sorts of skin problems. Ketu gives problems of intestine. Surprisingly planets like <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a>, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Mangal</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu</a> give good results especially in an influential rashi. Major filmstars, sports stars and some politicians have an influential 6th house. Placement of 6th house lord or 8th house lord or 12th house lord in 6th house gives a strange yoga called Vipreeta Raj Yoga in which person rises from ashes like phoenix and becomes successful in his life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6th house is also the house of debts. It gives a surprisingly clear insight on the matters and subjects where there are high chances of creating a debt. By carefully looking into the 6th house an individual can know where to invest/not invest his fortune so that he can gain profit and avoid debt. 6th house is also house of enemies. The more hostile planets in hostile rashi the more chances of a person having enemies. Some maybe disguised as your friends and well-wishers. 6th house is the best bet to finding your enemies and ways to counter them. Over and above that addictions of any type can be deciphered using planets located in the 6th house. 6th house is also the house of servants. In simpler terms whether you are born to be satisfied with your office role or whether there are chances to open your business can be know through combination of 6th house and 10th house. If there are more placement and aspects of planet on 6th house and no real strength in the 10th house your entire life would be spent as an employee or as a person who gives maximum service for minimum returns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6th house is one of the hell houses but when there exist problems in life there also exists solutions to overcome those problems. When there are diseases there can a search for cures. When there is a debt there is the will and effort to eradicate that debt. When there are enemies in life then people become smart and conscious as to not slip up. 6th house is the house which creates problems and obstructions in order for an individual to grow by overcoming them.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 11, '2014-02-01 12:00:20', 899, '', '2014-03-06 09:09:02', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 12:00:20', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 3, 6, '6th house, ripu bhava, shatru bhava, vedic astrology', '6th house in vedic astrology', 1, 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

House of Marriage (first marriage), 7th house is practically the most popular house of the 12 houses of astrology. Also known as kalatra Bhava, 7th house looks after marriage, business partnerships, travels and legal cases. While the accurate details of your life partner cannot be provided atleast a vague idea can be provided through 7th house and planets occupying or aspecting the 7th house.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every prospective bride/groom dreams of a perfect life partner. They seek nothing less of a soul mate destined to be together for eternity especially the love birds. 7th house is generally considered good if there are aspects of <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a>, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a> or <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6:shukra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shukra</a>. Planets located in the 7th house are generally undesirable as they cause delay or divorce. A problematic 7th house could guarantee legal cases. Such people are adviced not to venture into business partnership or sign documents without reading them. People who have late marriages are also likely to have planets like Guru, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a> or Chandra in 7th house or bad influence on 7th house or 7th house lord.

Most people forget that 7th house is the house of contracts and legal binding. Does it ring a bell? To simplify it idea of marriage being a perfection and heavenly arrangement doesn''t last long. That notion goes away once there is a transit of Shani or Ketu or aspect of Shani. Dreams are quite good while they lasts but when you wake up there is a harsh reality of being stuck in an unwanted relation for your whole life. Marriage turns from a holy and pleasurable experience into one which is worse then hell. Life takes time to understand that marriage is nothing but an unwanted agreement with legal repercussions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving the negativity aside marriage is still a wonderful experience to have. All the negativity combined cannot replace the idea that someone special is there for you through thick and thin, happiness and sorrow, health and sickness and through poverty and wealth sharing every experience that comes along the way. This is the true essence of 7th house- "An agreement which is not breakable, a partnership which is everlasting and a contract which cannot be void".</p>', '', 1, 11, '2014-02-01 12:02:32', 899, '', '2014-03-06 09:22:28', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 12:02:32', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 3, 5, '7th house, patni sthana, kalatra bhava', '7th house in vedic astrology', 1, 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

It causes tremendous transformation in lives of an individual which is generally not welcomed and regarded as adversity.

Of course 8th house just carries the mandate of karma which would lead the individual to a higher path. At the end of the day it is all a matter of perspective. Some consider transformation as painful while others consider it a blessing in disguise. According to a famous proverb- "One person''s funeral is another person''s bread".

If you are left with a huge fortune by your forefathers or just found a pot of gold while accidentally digging your house you could be rest assured there is a favorable 8th house.

As Shakespeare rightly put it- "The World is a stage and we are all actors". Everyone has to perform a specific task in the big machinery. 9th house is the place where one becomes aware of meaning of life but more importantly he becomes aware of his Dharma or Duty as a Person. Depending on planets and aspects a person may become religious, seek higher education, wander off to foreign lands and even try asceticism and divination.

It wouldn''t be an overstatement to say that atleast savings department of the <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11:dhana-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">2nd house</a> is subservient to the income department of the 11th house. In modern world where Money has gained so much prominense it has led to a scenario where the 11th house dictates terms on many matters of other houses particularly 2nd house, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14:putra-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">5th house</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16:kalatra-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">7th house</a>. No Money means No Savings. No Savings means No Marriage. No Marriage means no Social Identity. While this does not necessarily apply to every individual it holds true for many poor souls. Relationship of 11th house with other house lords could signal income through multiple portfolio''s. The better the condition of 11th house and 11th house lord the more beneficial results are obtained in matters of friends, income, social and business connections as well as chances for growth. Reverse is the case when 11th house and its lord are in problematic condition. While affiliation with the hell houses is not the most ideal scenario it may yield favorable results in the lords of hell house and lord of 11th house are friendly planets.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Labh Bhava also determines your friends and social circle. Imagine no friends on facebook or no connection on google plus or no followers on twitter. No real friends at school, work place or in general life. 11th house along with <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12:sahaja-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">3rd house</a> has gained prominence in the last few decades. Today 11th house is much more then means of livelihood and income. It controls your social standing through friends and professional standing through network connections. From a business perspective 11th house is the house of networks at market place. Any thriving business needs to be in contact with influential people at the market place. A good condition of 11th house ensures a businessman is always connected with the right people at the right position at the right time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most planets give favorable results in the 11th house baring <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6:shukra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shukra</a>. <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a> as the karaka for 11th house is the most ideal planet to have in the 11th house.

(21, 120, '12th house in horoscope', 'vyaya-bhava', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12th house is popularly known as Vyaya Bhava in Vedic Astrology. It is the house which gives grief, despair and losses to an individual. Losses are not just monetary but also emotional and physical. As one of the hell houses it can literally put individuals through the motions and create depression and anxities of unparallel quantities. 12th house also rules over prisons, ashrams, hospitals and mental institutions. On a better note it also rules research and doctarate programmes. But the most important of all is that the 12th house provides Moksha to an individual.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No one likes matters of the 12th house. Who would want to voluntarily go to prisons, hospitals or mental institutions? Who would like depression grief, despair and losses? Impact of 12th house is huge and the tag of Valley of Despair is apt for matters of this house. But after careful observation and practical experience a hypothesis starts to develop that the 12th house is perhaps the most misunderstood house in astrology.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While not many people reading this article would care to get Moksha, it is essential to know that no rebirth equates to no suffering. For those who do not believe in the concept of Moksha, there is higher knowledge and deeper meaning of life associated with the 12th house. An individual gains an understanding of concepts which are outside the scope of what is already known. This is the reason why research and doctarate programmes are under the wings of the 12th house as these are fields where knowledge is not yet present in this world. For those who don''t care two hoots about Moksha or Knowldge there is the most important aspect called bed pleasures ruled by 12th house. Many marriages break on complaints of incomplete or no sexual satisfaction derived from partners. 12th house ascertains whether you have a good life in bed or not. Perhaps more importantly it guarantees that your marriage is not broken on account of non-existent physical relationship with your partner.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12th house on the positive side also rules dreams and imagination. All the successful fictional writers are blessed with distinctive and vivid imagination by blessings of the 12th house. Not only that lecturers and researchers, Ashrams and Hospitals run by blessings of the 12th house. 12th house has lots of negatives but equal amount of positives.

Believers and Non-Believers both like to argue endlessly over the benefits and flaws of astrology. Believers often say how future can be predicted from the stars and constellations and how one can benefit from knowing the future. Non-Believers would often quarrel how a man is the architect of his own fortune and stars, planets and constellations have no part in deciding fate of the man.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which of them stands right? I would say both of them are right in a way. A logical person will know that a person born in an under-developed country and working in a blue collar job cannot influence the thoughts and actions of whole world as say a person who is born in US and who is part of a political system in there. So isn''t it right to say that stars did favor the one born in US.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then again if everything was decided by stars and planets there would be no place for hard work and perseverance. There would be no Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi or Thomas Edison. Hard Work, Dedication, Perseverance, Dignity, Discipline, Diligence and Patience are key factors found in most successful men and women.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which one is it? The answer would be a mixture of both. Astrology is a science of predicting future events based on mathematical and astronomical calculations but that alone is not enough. Hard Work and Sincere Efforts also play a major role in deciding success or failure for an individual. This site would hopefully shed some light on the comman misconcepts and illusions regarding astrology. It will hopefully help individuals to decide where to apply the Prarabdha (Fate) and where to apply Purusharth (Hard Work).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 19, '2014-02-02 02:48:01', 899, '', '2014-02-17 06:11:44', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-02 02:48:01', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"0","show_hits":"0","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 6, 2, 'vedic astrology, prarabdha, purushartha', 'main article on vedic astrology', 1, 14, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

Materialistic Pleasures in life have taken precedence over the basic necessities of life like health. Even if you get all the money in life it doesn''t have the power to cheer you up if you have an upset stomach or high fever. Yet most of us run after wealth and discard health.

A person can know about his physical and mental capabilities and diseases that occur frequently through the 1st House.

Careful consideration needs to be given to every aspect before judging health and vitality of a native.

Depending on <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6:shukra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shukra</a> or <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu''s</a> transits proximity between the two concerned individuals increases and desire to live with them through thick and thin of life starts to arise. During those happy times an individual feels nothing wrong with his partner and overlooks all of his/her flaws. Love shows a world which is full of hope and optimism. The concerned lover starts to enjoy and appreciate the blue skies above him and the colorful flowers around him. When they finally arise from their imagination land thanks to the transits of Mr. Reality Check called <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a> or Mr. Dissolution called <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9:ketu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Ketu</a> they see The Ugly Truth Of Relationship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While love is more of a privilege, relationship is more of a responsibility to stay together due to social norms. Everything is fine as long as you are in love but when that love disappears then you see the faults which you overlooked a long time ago. Suddenly the skies turn gray, sunshine is replaced by dark clouds and happiness is replaced by gloominess. All of a sudden lightning strikes his/her brain and he repents on how stupid he was to fall for the Relationship Trap. Bear in mind this is the critical point in life. Some individuals separate while other resourceful souls adapt and compromise while still staying together. The important thing to note is this is not due to any planetary yogas but through perseverance, satisfaction and compromise. This is the part where relationship changes from a duty to a privilege. Relationship is no longer a burden at this junction and becomes a relief to have been in a relation. Albeit this may take a lifetime to achieve and others quit and even try other alternatives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether you love a person, live in a relationship or have separated it is very important to understand that planetary combinations have a large say in it. While ultimately it is a choice of individuals the circumstances surrounding the choices are influenced by planets and past karma both good or bad.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 15, '2014-02-02 02:51:05', 899, '', '2014-02-04 08:07:32', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-02 02:51:05', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 2, 0, '', '', 1, 2, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

Education in today''s world equals Fancy Degree or Qualifications.

A career out of continuous education and research is also governed by the 12th house.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if either the 4th house or 5th house have unfavourable placements? As long as one of the concerned house is in good condition the native would do well. But if both the houses are disaster then rest assured the native would most likely be at bottom of the organization unless Career Houses (<a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15:rog-sthana&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">6th house</a>, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19:karma-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">10th House</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20:labh-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">11th House</a>) or Fortune Houses (<a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18:bhagya-sthana&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">9th house</a>, 11th House, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11:dhana-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">2nd House</a>) have a say in that.

(66, 236, 'Career', 'career', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The most asked questions in astrology are generally related to Marriage and Career. Quite an irony considering these two subjects are driven by Destiny. It is human tendency to ask for happiness and satisfaction in life and that is not possible without a stable and successful career. The web based definition of Career is "An occupation for a significant period of person''s life with opportunities for progress". Focus is on Significant Period and Opportunities. Unless it is for a long duration there is no stability and without stability there is no happiness or peace. Without Opportunities there is no growth and without growth there are no profits or savings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10th house and 6th house are analyzed by astrologers for Career. But what they should actually check is the 11th House which the House of Gains and Regular Income. After all everyone is in the business of making money so why bother with 10th house and 6th house. Any connection of the 11th house with any other planetary lords of any house would ensure profits or income in the given field. In a way it is not a bad idea to ignore 6th house and 10th house. But life''s purpose is governed by the 10th house and life''s debt are measured by 6th house. Since income is governed by destiny it is imperative to check the 6th house for person''s debt or service he must undertake and 10th house to know the Karma which was planned for him. For example if you are meant to be a doctor and to serve poor and needy then Karma would drive you in a place where people are poor and needy. If you are meant to be surgeon and earn millions through operating then Karma would drive you in that direction. End of the day it all depends on life''s purpose. No point running away from it whatever income you get.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you are planning Career in Business or as Top Executive in an organization a strong 10th House is prerequisite. Career in Service Roles, as Doctors or Social work is governed by the 6th House. 7th House governs Contracts, Business Partnership and Negotiations. 3rd House governs Communication, Public Relationship, Meetings and Media. 5th house governs Politics, Entertainment, &nbsp;and Theater. 8th House governs Taxes and Money Bonds. 2nd House governs Speech and Gold. 4th House governs Agriculture, Cattle Rearing and Transport. 11th House governs Quick Gains and Share Markets. 12th House governs Monasteries (Ashrams), Universities, Jails, Bedroom Pleasures. Depending on the strength of the house and the planetary lord of the house the precise career can be deciphered.&nbsp;Planetary combinations also can be used to decipher the career of an individual. Mangal+Budh makes for an excellent Engineer especially Hardware or Software Engineer. Shani+Budh can make for a good Chartered Accountant. Chandra+Shukra is the best for Entertainment business, Jewelry Design or Cosmetics. Guru+Chandra is ideal for setting up your own Business, Share Markets or Teaching. Surya can make an excellent Administrator or Farmer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All said and done stability in career depends on lot of other factors. It is rarely noticed that a person stays in the same career for his whole life. A Shani Saade-Saati or a bad Vimshottri Dasha is enough to put you out of job or business. Sometimes destiny could instigate a person to pursue change in occupation. Sometimes they may work in your favor while other times they may prove a catastrophe. Ultimately it is destiny of an individual which would drive him. So take pleasure in life''s work be it as a Chairman of a company or Cleaner in the same company.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 19, '2014-02-04 08:10:49', 899, '', '2014-03-24 06:06:44', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-04 08:10:49', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 2, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', '');

(67, 241, 'Shani and Superstition', 'shani-and-superstition', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As explained in the article <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a> it is unncessarily feared and usually his effects are blown out of proportions. There are a couple of odd superstitions related with Shani. It is a human tendency to feel anger, anguish and fear of things which we do not comprehend. But it is necessary to understand the cause of fear and worries to get a solution in life. Here are a couple of superstitions commonly associated with Shani which are dispelled through adequate reasoning. Furthermore the activities done or suggested to pacify Shani are also properly analyzed.</p>\r\n<p><strong style="font-size: 1em;">Superstition 1: Shani Saade Saati is always bad</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is the most unwarranted fear I''ve come across. As soon as a Saade-Saati starts people start to think that the next seven and half years of life would be hell. Some smart ones refer to an astrologer and decipher the effects of all 3 phases of two and half period to know which is the worst and which is favorable for them. Even the Jyotish instills unnecessary fear in the native and gives them wrong message.</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani Saade Saati is an excellent time to burn past life karma be it good or bad. It only gives back what you''ve given in the past life and this life before the Saade Saati began. Depending on your karma all 3 subperiods could be good like heaven or bad like hell. So just think of doing good karma and eventually nothing bad would happen. Ofcourse progress is stalled but that doesn''t mean you don''t get the fruits of your hard work ever.</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 2: Harsh Times go away by offering Oil to Shani and Lord Hanuman Idols</strong></h4>\r\n<p>This is another crazy theory propogated by astrologers and priest alike. Obviously they would make a fortune out of it so they would love to see more and more people coming to offer oil. Imagine a temple where everyone offers 100 ml of oil to the idols. Say 300 people come to the temple out of which 200 pour oil on the idol. That equates to 20 litre of oil being wasted on a Saturday alone. That are rough statistics for one temple. Say in India and abroad there are atleast 1000 temples of Lord Hanuman &amp; Shani. So Saturday amounts for 20,000 litres of oil wastage due to a stupid superstition. That oil could have been used to feed the poor, export to other countries or even cook for oneself (after all God resides in each and every soul)</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani is the karaka for Scarcity, Famine and Drought. Imagine you go to Sahara Desert and waste water in front of the native who resides there. You can imagine how angry he would be cause he has to struggle to get drinking water. Same way I can only imagine how mad Mr. Grandpa Shani would be by wastage of oil on idols. It is better to donate oil to a poor cause Shani is also a karaka for Poverty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Superstition 3: Shani Chalisa and Shani Prayers are needed to calm the effects of furious Shani</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I''ve seen people do religious mantra, superstitious activities and speak prayers of God and Gramps Shani all day long. While I am not against prayers of God, prayers to planet are not right in my opinion. They are just planets who follow a fix trajectory. They won''t change their trajectory for anyone. So why bother appeasing them?</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani couldn''t care less about appeasement cause he is a judge of people''s karma and he has to stay impartial and deliver due justice to the native. It doesn''t matter to him if you are a King or Servant, Rich or Poor, Religious or Non-Believer. I would suggest prayers to your favorite Gods once and to keep calm and continue to do your duties. That would be like a mercy plea in front of Judge Shani and he would oblidge and give mercy for sure.</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 4: Shani drishti is always bad</strong></h4>\r\n<p>These might not be totally false cause even the literatures on Shani propogate this theory. But what they also describe is Shani is the judge of one''s karma.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani gives results of past lives karma and that maybe an accumulation of many lives. Unless a native has done horrendous acts in his/her past lives it is not possible that horoscope houses which are aspected by Shani at birthtime keep on giving continuous bad results. What is necessary to know is Shani gives good or bad results to each house its transits or aspects when it moves in a Gochara Transit.</p>\r\n<p>In the end all I want to say is don''t fret about Shani like he is some relentless stalker or merciless killer. Just keep calm through periods of Shani and try to do your karma as effectively as you can. Understand that failures and disappointments are part and parcel of life and they help us stay grounded.</p>\r\n<p>Feel free to drop in a comment if you have any questions on the concerned article.</p>', '', 1, 20, '2014-02-04 08:12:14', 899, '', '2014-03-24 07:48:49', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-03-24 06:33:01', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 7, 0, '', '', 1, 1, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

Materialistic Pleasures in life have taken precedence over the basic necessities of life like health.

While only the sick (especially those who can''t find cures) seek astrology for guidance it is not a bad idea to look into a horoscope and find the most likely disease a body can be affected with. This can ascertain preventive measures to be taken before there is sickness.

Money can definitely buy pleasures but only sharing with family and friends can give real happiness. There maybe countless obstacles in life but when you have family, friends and well wishers all the difficulties in life seem trivial. A flower left alone would wither in no time and same way a person who is alone and lonely starts to feel sad and lonely after a while. The greatest assets in life are Friends and Family members and the greatest wealth in life is Health.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Importance of family is evident even in astrology where the <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10:tanu-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=114">1st house</a>&nbsp;in horoscope represents the native while the following house represents family of the native. <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11:dhana-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">2nd House</a> is also the karaka for life savings and assets.

Love starts with admiration, followed by attraction, followed by lust, followed by physical relationship and finally ends with contentment or dissolution. Ofcourse real love has no regrets or resentment and only wants the well being of the concerned love interest. But that love is unlikely barring a few yogas are in a horoscope.

(73, 243, 'Mangal Dosha', 'kuja', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mangal Dosha arises when Mars (Mangal) occupies 12th house, 1st house, 2nd house, 4th house, 7th house or 8th house in a horoscope. Some astrologers count both Chandra and Lagna house as ascendent. Chances that you have a Mangal Dosha shoot up from 50% to about 75% if both Chandra and Lagna are counted as ascendent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal Dosha is nothing to worry about. It is likely to be present in 50% of the population atleast. What is necessary to understand is the nature of Mangal. Mangal is fiery and strong, quick and trustworthy, harsh in speech but honest. Natives with a strong Mangal get angry quickly, are harsh in speech and fast excited and bored in relationship but it can also be said they are strong in calamities, trustworthy in relationship and honest with partners. So why the fear?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marriage is a contract which cannot be declared void as it has clauses. It is an agreement which cannot be broken without consequences. So it is only natural for astrologers and believers to fear Mangal Dosha. After all you couldn''t live with a person who is angered, craves excessive sexual pleasures and is harsh in speech for your whole life. Slowly but surely the detachment (Ketu) and despair (Shani) start to cloud a partner''s mind and partner eventually opts for divorce. Is it worth the risk going into marriage if such a scenario occurs? While these are far fetched theories and assumptions it is also necessary to accept that a human mind is prone to think positive or negative thoughts based on character and situations. Lets look at the most likely relationships which are likely to suffer adverse effects due to Mangal Dosha.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal in a horoscope (counted from lagna) casts a drishti on 4th, 7th and 8th house from its placement. In a marriage the native (suggested through 1st house), partner (suggested through 7th house), the immediate family of native (suggested through 2nd house) and immediate family of partner (suggested through 8th house), physical relationship (suggested through 12th house), vitality and life of native (suggested through 8th house) and life &amp; vitality of partner (suggested through 2nd house) play a very important role in long time survial of the marriage and Mangal in any of these locations is enough to bring Mangal Dosha into equation for astrologers. Mangal placement or drishti on the following houses causes problems according to astrologers. But it isn''t so wrong to say in today''s world as long as two people get along and have good physical relationship everything else is trivial. In the long term even the physical relationship is redundant and only the repo between two individuals is primary. But since humans like to socialize every equation for relationship is taken into consideration by astrologers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are various remedies on Mangal Dosha provided as mentioned below:</p>\r\n<p>1. Marrying another person with Mangal Dosha which may not always be useful</p>\r\n<p>2. Doing a Kumbh Vivah ceremony which requires native to marry a tree or idol of Vishnu before actual marriage. This practise may or may not give desired results. It is advised to only proceed if you have faith in this ceremony otherwise not to do if you feel it is superstitious and waste of time.</p>\r\n<p>3. Fasting from first tuesday of a month based on lunar calendar. This helps greatly especially if no salt is consumed on tuesday and less salt is consumed on other days. Reduction in sodium and potassium level not only reduces blood pressure but it also reduces excessive energy and fiery emotions in natives with a Mangal Dosha</p>\r\n<p>4. Donating blood once every three month. While this solution has no scientific or religious validity associated it is not a bad idea just for the sake of blood donation drive to prosper. It doesn''t harm an individual if blood is donated and it also helps the society.</p>\r\n<p>5. Worship Hanuman, reciting Sunder Kand and visiting Hanuman temples. This helps greatly cause Lord Hanuman is lord of wisdom. He has strength and courage but is humble and submissive at the same time. This trait is subconsiously cultiaved in native by prayers to Lord Hanuman.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal Dosha is not as troublesome issue for marriage as it is made out to be. All it requires is to be aware of it if indeed present in horoscope and if this dosha is not cancelled by other factors. Even if you don''t give a damn about Mangal Dosha it is worth to note that anger, too much sex and harsh speech can destroy any relationship and careful consideration needs to be given not to cross your limit in a relationship.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 20, '2014-03-24 07:33:41', 899, '', '2014-03-24 07:48:40', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-03-24 06:34:05', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 8, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(74, 247, 'Visha Yoga', 'visha-yoga', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visha Yoga is the combination of <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a>+<a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a> in a horoscope. Visha means Poison and this yoga can act as poison in life of individual. This yoga generally occurs every 27 days as it takes 27 days for moon to complete its rotation of earth and navigate via the 12 Rashis in a horoscope. While this yoga is catastrophic for most, it has been shown that a few natives do rise above this bad placement and do wonders in their respective fields. Visha Yoga is also called as Nitrubhasha Yoga or Shani-Chandra yoga.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The very name Visha Yoga is enough to send jitters down the spine of many. If the angle between Shani and Chandra is less then 12 degrees than it is rest assured that these yoga would show you hell on earth. Imagine yourself being assigned to a prison where you are bound by chains and there is is a stern and relentless warden who beats with a whip at the slightest mistake. If you imagine the pain, fear and trauma you are close to understanding what Vish Yoga natives feel inside their head. Abeit it is the mind of the natives which makes a mountain out of mole hill but the trauma experienced is similar to lifetime sentence in a dark, lonely prison. &nbsp;However Vedic Astrology is a classic case of paradox. What is written is quite opposite of what is observed. Many Vish Yoga natives are quite successful in life and can even be great contributors to the society. However what is largely observed is these natives get very low returns for the substantial amount of efforts put in. Unless they work very hard it is difficult for them to achieve anything in life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To understand Vish Yoga well we need to understand the characteristics of the two planets which form the Vish Yoga. Shani known as Saturn is made up of poisonous gases among other substances. Chandra known as Moon is responsible for causing tides and ebbs in the ocean as well as liquid substance in body. In astrology Chandra is the karaka for mind. Shani poisons the mind of a native so the term <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Vish Yoga</span>&nbsp;</strong>is used. Digging deeper into the subject. Shani is the karaka for fear, oppression, scarcity, povery and hard work while Chandra is the karaka for emotions, unrequited love, affection and mother. Both of the planets are polar opposites in terms of personality and characteristics. When these two opposing planets combine in a horoscope they tend to constantly collide with each other on matters of ideologies. The mind of the native cannot make up whether he should guide his emotions or let emotions guide him. Naturally what follows is depression and despair- a typical trait of Vish Yoga natives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The picture is far more gloomy cause they may even become paranoid incapable of trusting others or believing in power of love. They are always physically tired and mentally exhausted. Often they attempt suicide but Shani would not let them take an escape route. Ofcourse some poor souls do use that option but that road is ill-advised for Vish Yoga natives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shani is a cruel planet and association with karaka of mind makes the mind become cruel as well. Many dicatator and oppressors have Vish Yoga in their horoscope. These yoga also creates an emotional oppressor and such natives have often been observed to oppress others or give pain and despair to others. If <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Mangal</a> is associated they may actually derive happiness from torturing and harassing others. If Guru is involved they could actually help others instead of harming and practise empathy.&nbsp;Vish Yoga natives are quite harsh in speech. If Mangal is associated with Shani-Chandra placement then natives are observed to be sarcastic also. However if a benefic <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a> is aspecting the house where Shani-Chandra placement occurs then effects are neutralized. If <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu</a> is present with Shani+Chandra then the effects are greatly increased and there is no way for native to recover. Generally any sort of association of Chandra, Shani and Rahu via aspect or placement suggests a life which is result of very bad karmas in past lives. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So how to tackle this difficult placement? It is not at all easy. Whether to choose mandate of duties and responsibilties given by Shani or whether to go with emotions, love and care bestowed by Chandra.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Solution: Get your horoscope analyzed by an astrologer. If Vish Yoga is in a friendly rashi or exaltion rashi of Chandra then go with emotions otherwise all other scenarios go for duties and responsibilities of Shani. As long as you take one of the path rest all should work out fine. No matter which path you take you would require concrete efforts (Shani) to get your objective. So whether you are looking to help the world (Chandra) or bend the world (Shani) you need to focus on that objective. Do not dwell too much on other things and you are bound to end up as success in life.</p>\r\n<p>Remedies: All solutions for Vish Yoga are useless without prayers to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is the remover of darkness and negativity, the drinker of poison and God of Knowledge. Recitation of ''Om Namah Shivay'' specifically in evening and night is advised when moon is present. Also prayers to Lord Jesus or Lord Vishnu or any of his avatar are advised. They are gods of compassion and love. They teach to love and help mankind.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 14, '2014-03-24 11:10:58', 899, '', '2014-03-24 10:48:18', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-03-24 10:14:40', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 6, 0, 'visha yoga, paapa kartari yogas, shani chandra yoga, nitrubhasha yoga', 'vish yoga description', 1, 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(75, 249, 'Neech Bhanga Raja Yoga', 'nbry', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not much is said about Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga (NBRY) in traditional Vedic Astrology. It was later propogated by new age astrologers through case studies and experience. However what has largely been observed is there are valid reasons to believe that such yoga occurs in a horoscope. Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga is best explained by the story <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frog_Prince_(story)" target="_blank">Frog Prince</a> written by Grimm Brothers. Nothing in this world inspires people more then the underdog who fights all odds and wins. Rags to Riches story is an inspiration for all people who dream of similar fate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; NBRY in simple terms is a yoga which leads an underdog to perform above average deeds and acts. But for NBRY to occur a fundamental law is that the concerned person has to see humiliation and defeat in early part of life so much so that most of those around him start to question the native''s credentials. But these same humiliations and defeats are slowly but surely building the character of native. He starts to see things differently and sooner or later starts to find the ingredients which make him successful and renowned. Ofcourse to the outsiders who questioned him can never imagine that such a worthless scum could achieve unparalleled success so they merely pass it off as Got Lucky but for the native the story is different. He knows the hard work, sweat, patience and noble intentions he had to cultivate to reach that place among elites. In a way it can be said that the Neecha characteristics of the planet never goes away and such natives inspite of their position in life are always questioned by those around.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neecha Bhanga has some rules which are needed for its cancellation of neecha chracteristics. Some primary factors are mentioned below:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Neecha planet occupies the Vishnu Sthana or Laxmi Sthana from the Lagna or Chandra counted as Lagna.</li>\r\n<li>One of the co-tenants along with the neecha planet is an uccha planet or lord of the rashi (for eg. Guru in Makara Lagna along with Shani or Mangal as co-tenant)&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Neecha planet is retrograde (for eg. Retrograde Budh in Meena produces NBRY if Guru is located in Karka and native has Meena Lagna).&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>If the ruler of rashi of neecha planet is in kendra and in an uccha sthana or own rashi &nbsp;(for eg. Shani in Mesha would cause neecha bhanga if Mangal is in Makara)</li>\r\n<li>If the neecha planet is located in an uccha navamsha in Vishnu or Laxmi Sthana</li>\r\n<li>If the neecha planet has good Ashtvarga strength.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These are rough points and really there is actually a lot more to the equation. The term ''Neecha Bhanga'' actually differs from the term ''NBRY''. Neecha Bhanga is just the cancellation of neecha characteristics. In other words Neecha Bhanga leads person to lead a normal or above normal existence but does not have the capacity to turn a beggar into a king. Many people see Neecha Bhanga in their life cause one of the above equations is possible to be present in the horoscope. But NBRY has that capacity to turn dirt into gold. That rarely happens in my humble opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One way to know about NBRY is to check the above mentioned points for NBRY particularly the first four points, Afterwards try to honestly answer if you have found your higher purpose in life. As crazy as it sounds people with NBRY tend to live a life devoted to a fixed purpose and that purpose generally involves well-being of others. So if you are still restricted to personal well-being you are not ready to get the NBRY in your horoscope even if present. After all it is not easy to care for others who hurt you and make fun of you. When you learn to accept criticism with dignity and achieve patience, hope, faith and humility is the time when NBRY gives full fruit. More important then that is your purpose to do something in life which would benefit others. At that time even the Gods would bend down and give respect so how can planets be an exception.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 14, '2014-03-24 11:16:05', 899, '', '2014-03-24 10:50:17', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-03-24 10:16:35', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 4, 0, 'neecha bhanga, neech bhang, neech bhanga, yogas for elevation', 'neech bhanga raja yoga description', 1, 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(76, 251, 'Vipreeta Raja Yoga', 'vry', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vipreeta Raja Yoga like <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83:neech-bhanga&amp;catid=13:imp-yogas&amp;Itemid=113">NBRY</a>&nbsp;didn''t have much prominence in the early Vedic Astrology. But later in modern astrology these yogas have gained prominence. Vipreeta Raja Yoga (VRY) is a yoga formed when the lord of dushamsthanas are located in dushamsthanas. There are a host of rules for occurence or cancellation of these yoga which are discussed in details in this article.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first and foremost thing to understand is Vipreeta Raja Yoga is essentially a dushamsthana planet in a dushamsthana placement. In mathamatics two negatives always result in positive but in astrology it is not always the case though astrology is highly influenced by mathematics. Even if VRY occurs in life it actually take time before it gives fruition just like NBRY. Normally period of 36-42 years may already have passed before the circumstances turn Vipreeta or opposite to past and current bad scenario. Life is always ready to provide opportunities to individuals but the <a title="Prarabdha Article" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81:prarabdha&amp;catid=41:main-articles">Prarabdha</a> determines whether the concerned native would make the most of ray of hope provided or let it pass.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>First we would look at the various types of Vipreeta Raja Yoga</p>\r\n<p>1. Harsh Yoga: When lord of 12th house is in 6th house then Harsha Yoga is said to be formed. Some text mention lord of any dushamsthana house in 6th house gives rise to Harsh Yoga. This yoga makes a person fortunate, happy, invincible, strong, sturdy, wealthy and famous.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. Sarala Yoga: When lord of 8th house is located in 8th house then Sarala Yoga is formed. Some text say lord of any dushamsthana houses in 8th house causes Sarala Yoga. This yoga makes a person long-lived, fearless, happy, invincible, learned, a terror to his enemies, wealthy, famous, celebrated and prosperous.</p>\r\n<p>3. Vimala Yoga: When lord of the 6th house occupies the 12th house, Vimala Yoga is formed. Some text say lord of any dushamstahana in 12th house causes Vimala Yoga. This yoga makes a person independent, endowed with noble qualities, wealthy, happy and economical in spending.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are rules of cancellation of VRY which are mentioned below.</p>\r\n<p>1. The lord of Dushamsthana Houses is also a lord of Laxmi Sthanas</p>\r\n<p>2. When there is Parivartana Yoga between any of the Dushamsthana House Lords.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. Lords of 10th house or Laxmi Sthanas should not be present in the dushamsthana house where VRY occurs. For example: For Mithuna Lagna lord of house 6 is Mangal. If Mangal is located in 12th house then Vimala Yoga is formed. But if Guru or Budh is also present with Mangal in 12th house then the result of VRY won''t be obtained.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vipreeta Raja Yogas are too difficult to judge just like <a title="Neech Bhanga Raja Yoga Link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83:neech-bhanga&amp;catid=13:imp-yogas&amp;Itemid=113">NBRY</a>. Countless permutations and combinations have to be deciphered before coming to the right conclusion. What is generally observed is most of natives with a dushamsthana lord in dushamstha house are presented with some sort of help against the flow of circumstances. Some take that helping hand and do wonders in their life while others keep on looking for all the lights to turn green and they never do turn green. If you have a dushamsthana planet in a dushamsthana location the best thing to do is keep calm and work towards a fixed goal. When there is an opportunity presented that same calmness and previous efforts would give fruitful results.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 14, '2014-03-24 11:19:43', 899, '', '2014-03-24 10:49:18', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-03-24 10:21:21', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 3, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', '');

(77, 253, 'Vipra Chandal Yoga', 'vcy', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vipra Chandal Yoga (VCY) is the yoga formed when <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu</a> combine together in the same house in a horoscope. It is also called Guru Chandal Yoga. This yoga generally arises when a native has insulted or wronged a honest, pious and spiritual soul in the past livesl.&nbsp;Vipra in Sanskrit means a brahmin or pious soul while Chandal means a ghastly, roaming and uncultured person. Guru is considered Vipra while Rahu is considered Chandal so the name Vipra Chandal Yoga. Ofcourse modern day interpretation of Rahu is quite different. Today Rahu represents the PR (Public Relations) Machine who can sell anything whether the product or person is worth the money or not. Alas! No matter how good the packaging is if the product isn''t nice then there are bound to be unhappy customers. Similar is the fate of modern day PR Machine called Rahu, Eventually people see through the deceit and cunningness and you can expect tomatoes, shoes and eggs being hurled at you if you go by Rahu''s fake PR.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every 7-8 years the smart, quiet, sensible, pious and religious Guru combines with the faker, poser, liar in Rahu and the problematic VCY is formed. When two opposing grahas combine in a horoscope house there are bound to be fights and struggles. In normal scenario two grahas located in one horoscope house start to get along after sometime and learn to adjust and accommodate each other. Sometimes they even compliment each other but when Rahu combines with any graha the opposite is true. Rahu is desire, lust and greed personified. Rahu may turn good and humble for few days but inner cravings and desire don''t go away. Sooner or later he resorts to illegal, unreligious and unethical activities to get the things he desires. The problem here is Guru is so religious and righteous that he cannot fathom illegal activities. So the cursed yoga called VCY or Guru Chandal Yoga is formed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When two or more grahas are in the same horoscope the strongest placement always wins and dictates terms for other grahas. So if Guru is strong in a &nbsp;horoscope then he would dictate terms and generally a good character, religious nature and honest individual is observed. But if Rahu is strong then person is drawn by immoral activities, is an athiest or fakes religion for personal gains and even resorts to illegal activities. Before judging the effects of Guru Chandal Yoga it is necessary to get your horoscope analysed and know the strength of Guru. Below are the effects of VCY in various houses:</p>\r\n<p><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10:tanu-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=114">1st House</a>: When VCY is formed in the 1st house the native begets an immoral character and is inclined to unethical deeds, unsocial desires and cravings. He maybe unapologetic and ungrateful to others. If VCY is formed with Guru in strong position then native maybe religious, kind hearted, learned and inclined to follow social norms.</p>\r\n<p><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11:dhana-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">2nd House</a>: If Guru is not strong then native may have problems in speaking clearly and may even stammer or lisp. Native may have a hard time in creating any savings. Relationship with family members also suffers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12:sahaja-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">3rd House</a>: Frictions with siblings and animosity with them is suggested. Native may have to suffer in foreign lands. Sometimes he has to come back after losing a fortune in foreign lands. Many resolute activities provide little or no gains for native. Desired success is not possible no matter how concrete the efforts.</p>\r\n<p><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13:matru-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">4th House</a>: In 4th house VCY causes frequent changes in residence. Legal cases in property matters and inheritance also quite high. Very little inheritance and parental property suggested. If Guru is in good condition reverse case is true.</p>\r\n<p><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14:putra-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">5th House</a>: In 5th house VCY causes troubles in conceiving children. Enmity with children or death of children is also possible. Native may get bad publicity due to no fault of his. Heavy losses in stock exchange or gambling possible if Guru is in bad disposition.</p>\r\n<p><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15:rog-sthana&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">6th House</a>: Health suffers when Guru Chandal Yoga is formed in 6th house.

But if Guru is in a good condition native maybe religious, successful and visits or lives on foreign shores.</p>\r\n<p><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19:karma-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">10th House</a>: VCY in 10th house gives instability in career and native has to frequently change jobs. Chances of promotion are few and far fetched. There are friction with boss and father and there is no enjoyment at workplace.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20:labh-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">11th House</a>: VCY in 11th house cause failures in studies.

One has to travel to foreign locations for religious purpose or to earn a living. But there is loss of savings and in some cases even legal cases and prison sentence possible if Guru is in bad position.</p>\r\n<p>Remedies for Vipra Chandal Yogas: Though there are countless remedies suggested the best remedy is to offer services (seva) to an elderly, teacher, guru or priestly person. This yoga occurs when a righteous person is insulted or wronged so it is only natural to correct that wrong by giving the right respect back to a righteous person. Prayers to Lord Dattatreya or chanting of Vishnu Sahasaranama are also advised. Try not to do any special poojas unless it is absolutely necessary. Focus on helping elderly and things would work out just fine.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 14, '2014-03-24 11:22:09', 899, '', '2014-03-24 10:23:49', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-03-24 10:22:32', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 3, 0, 'guru chandra yoga, vipra chandal yoga, guru chandal yoga, guru+rahu', 'guru chandal yoga description', 1, 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

RY natives beget health, wealth and valor. They can achieve high position in police, army or in entertainment industry. They enjoy unparalleled fame and popularity. Sometimes they are more popular than their bosses or Politicos. There is a downside to Ruchaka Yoga in that they can''t be successful in areas like Politics, Diplomacy or Negotiations. They are born to be fighters and do not know the art of tact and deceit. Period of Mangala is extremely beneficial to Ruchaka Yoga natives.&nbsp;According to some texts Ruchaka Yoga natives earn lands and houses and riches. They are blessed with wife and children who are healthy and wealthy.

(87, 279, 'Prarabdha', 'prarabdha', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Vedic Astrology there are concepts of Prarabdha and Purushartha. Prarabdha in English means Fate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Prarabdha of an individual plays a big part in shaping his life. If an individual is meant to rise from Rags to Riches then Prarabdha pushes him in that direction. If he is meant to fall down from a top position in life then Prarabdha pushes him in that direction. It all depends on karma of an individual or in other words Purushartha. To a believer of Prarabdha, fate controls the destiny while for a believer of Purushartha, hard work controls the destiny. Actually the reality is somewhere in the middle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prarabdha and Purushartha are not on collision course but rather run parallel and meet at some point of the road. The Purushartha of today becomes the Prarabdha of tomorrow. The Prarabdha faced today maybe a result of Purshartha of yesterday. Similarly today''s Prarabdha may decide the Purushartha for tomorrow. In astrological terms the placement and aspect of benefic planets like Guru, Shukra and Chandra drive the good Prarabdha while placement and aspect of malefic planets like Shani, Mangal, Rahu and Ketu suggest bad Prarabdha which befalls a native. But there is the quintessential question as to where should one apply Prarabdha and where should one apply Purushartha. Vedic Astrology and ancient Vedic Text suggests leaving matters of Artha Houses (2nd house, 6th house and 10th house) and Kama Houses (3rd house, 7th house and 11th house) to Prarabdha. Well to be more accurate leave matters of Savings, Popularity in Media, Matters of Debt, Marriage, Business Partnership (success or failure in partnership), Career Standing, Financial Gains and Quality and Quantity of Friends to Prarabdha. Not every matter in the concerned houses is better to leave to Prarabdha but knowing that Artha Houses and Kama Houses are driven by Prarabdha saves pain in future as they are beyond one''s control.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Kabir rightly said in his doha:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>“Manushya kadi balwaan nahi; Samaya sab se balwaan<br />Kaabe Arjuna lutiyo; Wahi dhanush wahi baan”</h4>\r\n<p>Translation: Time is far more powerful compared to the human. The greatest of the warrior Arjuna lost to a bunch of tribesman of forest even though he was using the same quiver and arrows which he used to defeat mighty warriors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Countless stories exist to justify Saint Kabir''s views. But the point put across is not to get arrogant or conceited if you find victory and not to get deflated and lose hope at loss.

It is the driving force and the foremost reason why astrology gets it wrong in terms of forecasting future of the native. Just like there are Variants, Pie Values, Friction and Worst Case Scenarios in Mathematics, Science and Programming which cause calculations to go awry there is Purushartha in astrology which puts all the calculations as meaningless and native achieves things which cannot be calculated at birth. This single word maligns astrology like no other one does yet this article is only meant to praise this nemesis called Purushartha cause it is truly a great nemesis.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Purushartha is nothing but hard work without any sort of expectations in return. The very essence of Bhagvad Gita can summarize Purushartha like no one else can:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;"One cannot achieve anything without doing Karma (Purushartha). Don''t try to get anything for free. No work is bereft of gains. One should not ever get depressed in life. One should not lose confidence while doing his Karma (Purushartha)." -- Pandurang Athvale</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Purushartha and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81:prarabdha&amp;catid=41:main-articles">Prarabdha</a> are not on collision course but run parellel and intersect at some point of the long road. So people who loathe fate and luck should not get agitated at those who believe in it and those who believe in fate and luck should understand that today''s hard work is tomorrow''s good luck. Some people are born with the knowledge of what Purushartha he needs to pursue to be successful in life. Generally they are the people who taunt everyone else with early success. What they fail to realize is that Prarabdha was responsible for making them pursue the respected field and gain success. By taunting others today''s bad karma would become bad Prarabdha for tomorrow and hit them hard on the face.&nbsp;In similar manner people who believe too much in luck and fate refuse to get out of their cocoon and work hard towards a fixed objective. What they fail to realize is today''s Purushartha would result in good karma and ultimately good Prarabdha in the future.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a dilemma in people when it comes to using Purushartha or &nbsp;applying Prarabdha.

To be more precise one should try hard for a good character, good health, good education, being religious as well try hard to get peace and happiness, think of death and rebirths and also work towards minimizing losses as well as gaining liberation from cycle of life and death by attaining Moksha.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Astrologers are generally not sought until situation is worse and all hope is lost. Some people are highly negative and consult astrologers to find out the right time to eat and sleep. What I personally advise is to learn about your Purushartha or goal of your life from astrologers as nothing is wrong in that. After that only visit him in times of calamity for solutions if possible through astrology. An honest astrologer is sure to give you right advise about the right course of action to take.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally don''t lose hope when all is lost and don''t get over the moon when you gain everything you''ve set out to do.

(14, 'com_content.article', 'Chandra', 'chandra', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moon popularly known as Chandra in Vedic Astrology is the planet of affections and emotions. It is a karaka for mind and everything related to it. Moon also affects the blood circulation as well as water portions on the body and on earth. Well that implies nearly 70% of body and of earth are affected by Chandra. Chandra maybe a small planet and it only stays in a rashi for 2.5 days but its implications are huge when you take the co-tenants, rashi and house lords into consideration. Chandra brings tides and ebbs in an ocean and similarly it brings tides and ebbs in a human mind also. Every positive or negative, good or evil, happy or sad, nice or bad thought that comes to an individual is thanks to chandra and associations and afflictions to chandra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moon is the closest planet to the earth. Theoretically it is a satellite. Just like satellites are responsible for good and bad signals in a television; Chandra is responsible for good and bad thoughts in an individual. <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu</a> association with Chandra is a prime factor for people with weak or malefic thought process. Of course the rashi occupied by Chandra also plays an important role in shaping the thought process of an individual. Generally speaking association of Chandra to Shani, Rahu, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Mangal</a>, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4:buddh&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Budh</a>, <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:surya&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Surya</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9:ketu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Ketu</a> is considered bad. Though bear in mind it is not always the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is highly impressionable graha. It quickly takes in the qualities of its rashi, co-tenants and grahas which aspect it.&nbsp;Lets talk in more detail about Chandra and associations with other planets.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Surya is called as Amavasya or No Moon. Many astrologers and jyotishis push the panic button once they hear of this scenario. Various havans, poojas and rings are provided to calm these so called horrible scenario. Well the truth couldn''t be farther off. Well Surya is soul and Chandra is the mind and it wouldn''t be so bad if soul and mind become one considering that soul is considered part of god and mind is the most definiting part in an invidual.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Mangal is considered auspicious by many astrologers cause it gives abundant wealth. That is partly true but they forget to mention that this association gives rise to a wounded warrior who is always there to take revenge on others.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Budh is probably among the worst. Most mental disorders are caused by this association. Chandra controls the mind while Budh takes care of nervous system. Not to mention this association causes an individual to be a chatter box.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association to Guru is probably the best. In a favourable rashi it causes a powerful yoga called Gaja Kesari yoga. It gives abundant wealth, happiness and prosperity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Shukra is also good. It provides abundant love. Most of the romeo-juliet stories are thanks to Chandra-Shukra association. The fairest and most beautiful looking individuals both male and female are very likely to have assocation of Chandra with Shukra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Shani causes Vish Yoga. The mind is constantly in thinking process and nothing comes out of tireless thinking but sadness and worries. Depression is one of the possible scenarious with Shani-Chandra association. But people who learn to control their emotions and adapt to difficulties and changing scenarios become great individuals but that doesn''t come without a struggle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra with Rahu is bad in general terms. Rahu is cloudy and smokey and causes disruption to natural though process. Simply speaking this association clouds judgement of an individual.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Ketu is bad for some and good for some. Ketu is the planet of detachment. Well for those who want to get closer to the god; this placement provides the right tools of obtaining that goal. For those who are too caught up with materialistic success; consider this placement to quite a bother and probably arrange for some counter measures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is very small but its implications on human beings are pretty big. It alone is a gentle, calm and caring graha but depending on rashi lordship or co-tenants it could bring peace or havoc in your life. The greatest enemy or friend of an individual is not anyone but his mind and thoughts. Once you control your own mind; controlling this world is not that difficult.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-02-01 11:44:20', 899, '2014-03-19 07:48:24', '*', '2014-02-01 11:44:20', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 2, 83, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 17, 5, 8, 'chandra in vedic astrology, chandra in astrology, chandra in 12 bhava, chandra in 12 rashi', 'chandra in vedic astrology', 10, '', 1),
(15, 'com_content.article', 'Mangal', 'mangal', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mars popularly known as Mangal is another planet along with Shani who invokes fear in the minds of people especially for those who are of the age where marriage takes priority. A Mangal Dosha is a tragedy for the bride/groom and their parents yet a boon for the astrologers. No one is bothered to know that the very word "Mangal" means good and auspicious. Ofcourse mars is a fiery planet and has his sort of problems associated with itself but it is better to understand why this fiery planet is so angry and cold before making any judgement on people who are influenced very highly by this planet.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal is considered a male planet. To be more precise people born under the infuence of mars are the macho types. These includes females also. The ladies who like to order, shout and get angry to get things done are mostly under the influence of a strong mars in horoscope. Mars has a lot of high octane energy. People under the influence of Mars keep on doing relentless work, want everything on time, get angry at smallest inaccuracies of co-workers or employees and worst of all keep others on their toes. Mars hates laziness and lies. These are the reasons why they are the ideal employees but not-so great employers. Mangal is least likely to cause downfall of others. They may get angry, make enemies, use harsh speech but they rarely ever keep enemity for lives. They may get angry very fast but their anger also calms down after some time. But none the less Mangal does have its share of handicaps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mangal is impatient and very harsh in speech. People under influence of Mars often make rash decisions and make enemies out of people due to their high moral values and principles. The world is not so honest and sincere. It is full of scums and leeches who thrive on looting and cheating others. Since Mangal cannot stand these things he is always at logger-heads with these people. A bride or groom who has Mangal in a prominent position cannot compromise on his/her ideals and principles. That is why a lot of quarrels happen and eventually divorces happen. Ofcourse astrologers do not help the cause by matching partners with Mars or <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a>&nbsp;in a prominent position of the partner.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; None the less Mars does have its good side. Mars influence people easily sacrifice their own goodwill for people for whom they care. They would give up their profit for others to avoid loss. If any sort of association with Jupiter is present they could even bear loss if those they care for are profited from their sacrifice.&nbsp;Most of the prominent actors, sportsperson, celebrities and good army commanders have Mars in a very good position. Mars influence people do great in places where everything needs to be done on time like railways and armies. They make very competent lawyers and deal makers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; In my view some people are born for the benefit of the community. They are there to make a difference. Mars influenced people are one of them. They may not be the most charming people to stay around but they are the most trustworthy, hard working and kind hearted people to be friends with.&nbsp;</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-02-01 11:45:23', 899, '2014-03-06 07:59:59', '*', '2014-02-01 11:45:23', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 3, 85, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 0, 3, 7, 'mangal in vedic astrology, mangal in 12 rashi, mangal in 12 bhava, mangal dosha, mangal in astrology, mars in astrology', 'mangal in vedic astrology', 10, '', 1),
(16, 'com_content.article', 'Budh', 'budh', '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercury known as Budh in Vedic Astrology is the prince among planets. Budh is young, talkative and smart. Budh is generally very close to Surya in a horoscope with maximum distance being 28 degrees from each other. Budh provides common sense, speech, communicative skills and also commands the neural processes in the brain. Budh and Guru are almost identical in that both are scholars but in present scenarios the smart and argumentative Budh wins over the knowledgable but dignified Guru. Budh takes the qualities of its co-tenants easily be it good or bad. It is a very impressionable graha. Though Budh doesn''t see most planets as enemies other then Chandra, many see him as their enemy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this age of PR those who can market themselves get more brownie points over others. Thanks to Budh you can effectively communicate your point across to others be it via speech or via writing. Most of the scientific research and innovations are possible due to the ideas and itellact provided by Budh. Be warned that plain old Budh is nothing but sweet talk. It needs a driver to put argument into efforts and theories into practise. Grahas like Mangal, Shani and Surya''s association with Budh are the drivers behind most important inventions. Budh is a businessman or more precisely a sales man. He can sweet talk anybody into buying a product be it good or bad. Most effecient salesman, call centre operatives, shop keepers and marketers need a good Budh for success in their fields. Those who have a weak Budh may suffer from speech defects, bad communicative skills as well as mental disorders.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budh is a very impressionable graha. Like Chandra it takes the qualities of its rashi, house and co-tenants very easily. A plain old Budh rarely makes or breaks a person. With planet Surya as its co-tenant a very powerful yoga is formed known as Budh-Aditya yoga which provides knowledge, wealth and heppiness. Though not everyone gets the benefit of Budh-Aditya yoga. Association of Budh+Mangal is difficult to judge. Sometimes this association causes catostrophe because Budh is calm while Mangal is restless. Two opposing forces staying in a rashi would provide disaster. But there are times when Budh provides direction to the abundant energy of Mangal. Many great individuals have a favorable association of Budh+Mangal. Many successful lawyers have Budh+Mangal relationship in their horoscope. Budh+Guru is a favorable association by and large. Guru''s knowledge is supported by Budh''s analytical, communicative and argumentative skills. In not so favourable location you could see a thug who uses his knowledge and speech to cheat others. Either way you are guaranteed to see a smart and successful individual when Budh+Guru is there in a horoscope. Budh+Shukra is also a very good combination. Musicians and Artists are likely to have association of Mangal+Budh. Budh+Shani provides good Mathematicians and Chartered Accountants.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budh is royalty by nature and more importantly royalty without duties. So you can''t expect Budh to understand problems or do proactive work or go out of his way to help others. Budh articulate and refined speech are sure to win over a few people, but long term they are bound to see that he is nothing but trash talk. Budh''s association with Mangal, Shani or Surya in a favorable location provides great results for individual as well as the community.</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-02-01 11:46:04', 899, '2014-03-06 08:02:57', '*', '2014-02-01 11:46:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 4, 87, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 0, 3, 6, 'budh in vedic astrology, budh in astrology, budh in 12 bhava, budh in 12 rashi', 'budh in vedic astrology', 10, '', 1),

It gives a positive outlook in life, gives a calm personality and pleasing appearance. A strong guru signifies a person who is learned, smart, calm and dignified. Guru gives a firm and unwavering faith in god and provides knowledge of Truth. Knowledge alone can free a soul from the worldy chains that plague the human soul and takes the soul closer to its maker aka The God.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jupiter maybe the most benefic planet in a horoscope but it does have its share of negative influence like any other planet. People with Guru in a prominent position often are a bit chubby. Guru promotes well being but unfortunately it promotes laziness and gluttony also. Guru cause a person to be fat, chubby and easy going.

Shukra with Shani is quite bad as Shani''s negativity is a damp squid for sensual and pleasurable Shukra. But since both planets are friendly it rarely causes destruction. An aspect of Shani or Guru on Shukra is quite a blessing to have. Shukra also gives love for animals and provides benefits through them in a favourable placement.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most beautiful woman and fortunate man have Shukra in a very good disposition. All the famous celebrities have a good Shukra or a favourable period of good Shukra. While Guru may give wealth, happiness and knowledge to a native leave it to Shukra to give you the finer things in life. Shukra natives are like a horse wihout a lease which can run off anywhere he/she pleases. The kind of ecstacy, pleasures and forbidden desires which Shukra provides can only be dreamt by other planets. Fame and fortune is abundant for people with a good Shukra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ofcourse with no boundary between acceptance and taboo most of the Shukra influenced people go bonkers after a certain time start resorting to drugs or even medicines to calm their mind. Romance and Sensual pleasures could be over the top but so is the risk of catching a venereal disease. Love takes a backseat and lust would control your mind and body unless there is a limiting aspect of Guru or Shani involved. The price of being a celebrityy is high with no privacy or peace but those who only crave for Page 3 lifestyle should start pleasing dear sweet aunty known as Shukra. For people with problematic Shukra praying to Lord Krishna or Goddess Laxmi for improving the condition and Goddess Santoshi Maa for decreasing the side-effects of afflicted Shukra is highly beneficial.</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-02-01 11:46:57', 899, '2014-03-06 08:07:23', '*', '2014-02-01 11:46:57', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 6, 91, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 4, 3, 4, 'shukra in vedic astrology, shukra in astrology, shukra in 12 bhavas, shukra in 12 rashi, shukra in astrology', 'shukra in vedic astrology', 10, '', 1),

Shani represents scarcity, fear, oppression, old age and poverty. Well that alone seems to put this humble planet in the category of worst of the worst. By all means Shani can be said to be a malefic planet who brings adversities and havoc in our lives but the perspective has to change regarding how we look at adversities to understand the working of Shani a little more.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start by saying that Shani is appointed as a judge by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/shiva.htm">Lord Shiva</a> himself. A normal judiciary functions according to laws of the country and Shani functions according to divine laws of the nature. Shani is aware of most of our karmas and he provides punishments befitting our crimes. Most of the human beings are far from noble souls. We lie, steal, ridicule others and even deceive or backstab others. This is not limited to one birth time but continues over several births and rebirths. Though we may not be aware of these crimes, gramps Shani keeps a watchful eye over these karmas. Remember, he cannot punish you unless you have done some crime. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why the fear of gramps Shani? Well, we are human beings after all. We cannot fathom why we need patience, hard work and discipline while the other guy gets the ferraris, the beautiful mansions and the iPhones. The sooner we learn the need for discipline, hard work, patience, fortitude and empathy the sooner does gramps Shani move out of our way. He does give wonderful results to those who plan the long road to success with honest and sincere efforts and plan betterment of the community and world. But those good fruits take a long, long time to come. By that time your patience is tested to the limits and your ego and arrogance is washed away. You are new and renewed all dignified, kind and considerate to your fellow beings. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is gramps Shani good or bad? Well he is bad cause we often plan shortcuts in life and easy way out of misery and suffering. That is the sole reason why Shani makes our lives a miserable hell. Say you are a prisoner in a jail and the warden catches you &nbsp;trying to sneak out of jail before your sentence is over. Most of us would assume that the warden would be very upset and may sentence us to more severe punishment. Same thing applies to Shani but he actually cares for his prisoners and wants them to be contributing members of the society. We do not like Shani cause he is a strict teacher who likes to whip now and then to teach some discipline and hard work to his students. No one likes to learn the things the hard way so to speak.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said all this Shani has positive aspects in life also. Most of the guys who grow from rags to riches have Shani in an important disposition in their horoscope. Most of the people who make a difference in lives of others have Shani in exalted or own sign or in a good position. Shani destroys everything that is not sustainable over a long period of time. That includes relationships. Most of the divorces happen during the Saade-Saati or Shani Periods. Though it may seem like hell at that time after some time we come to realise that the relationship couldn''t have worked out and what happened was for the better. Our ego is destroyed and we learn the importance of patience and dignity. At the end of saade-saati most people develop a positive outlook towards lives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day it all comes down to perspective. A simple, easy-going life is a choice of most but attainable by few. Those who believe in making lemonade, when lemons are provided fare much better in life then those who cry while looking at the lemons. Success is not defined by how high a person rises but how many times a person gets up after falling.&nbsp;</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-02-01 11:47:34', 899, '2014-03-06 08:10:11', '*', '2014-02-01 11:47:34', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 7, 93, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 9, 4, 3, 'shani in vedic astrology, shani in astrology, shani in 12 bhava, shani in 12 rashi, saade-saati, shani and superstition', 'shani in vedic astrology', 10, '', 1),
(20, 'com_content.article', 'Rahu', 'rahu', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rahu is a shadow planet and is considered the north node of the moon. It is also termed as a dragon''s head in some places while in vedic astrology Rahu has the head of a snake. According to vedic astrology, Rahu is responsible for causing eclipse to Sun and the Moon. Rahu is &nbsp;smokey and mysterious. He represents black arts, magic, taboo activities and foreigners. Rahu is an impersonator who tries to show the qualities he does not have. He is considered a malefic planet and astrologers make quite a fortune out of the so-called bad yogas associated with it. Well, the truth couldn''t be further off.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rahu is a planet in vedic astrology and like in all planet''s case certain rules and regulations apply. The placement of Rahu at time of birth is fixed according to previous life karmas. Rahu is the most accurate measure to judge the sins of previous life karmas depending on his placement in horoscope along with its drishti. Rahu carries the mandate of putting a human being under illusion. Rahu encourages individuals to take risky and foolish decisions which only bring harm and loss for him. Ofcourse, sometimes it gives quite favorable results for people interested in forbidden desires and&nbsp;taboo activites. Not only that money, power, sex and fame are also abundant in a favorable period of Rahu.&nbsp;Most politicians have a very good Rahu. Rahu is a karaka for foreigners and everything mysterious. Rahu is one of the planets which in a favorable position can suggest a successful chance of going and settling abroad. Rahu in 4th house, 9th house and 12th house suggests if individual will live and stay away from home and in foreign locations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rahu magnifies the bad effects and lessens the good effects of planet which is its co-tenant. It is generally favorable if Rahu is alone in a house with no co-tenants and not casting drishti on any planet. Rahu causes eclipse to the Sun and the Moon. In other words the intelligence and rational thinking are hindered due to Rahu. Bad decisions, tough luck and mental problems follow. The individuals who have <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:surya&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Surya</a>+Rahu or <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a>+Rahu in the same house are better off when they consult others for major decisions in their lives. Rahu+<a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Mangal</a> is not as bad but cause relationships with siblings to go sour and also promotes anger, restlessness along with frustrations at not getting things done on time. Rahu+<a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a> is famously known as Viprachandal Yoga. The simple and wise Guru meets Rahu who is full of deceit and camaflouge. Naturally they don''t get along well. Rahu+Shukra is not as bad and actually gives quite good results. People with Shukra+Rahu are often driven by taboo activites and forbidden desires. The bad results of Rahu+Shukra are blind love followed by divorce. Rahu+<a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a> gives rise to Shapit yoga.

It tries to mirror <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6:shukra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shukra</a>&nbsp;but he is an imposter.

(21, 'com_content.article', 'Ketu', 'ketu', '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ketu is another shadowy planet like <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu</a> which features prominently in Indian Astrology.

It is a malefic planet but that does mean it is literally bad. The facts about Ketu are often misinterpreted to suit the worldy desires so much so that it has lost its divine purpose. Ketu is capable of taking an individual closer to moksha. Only <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a> is the other planet which can boasts of this great feat. The final purpose of all living beings is to get closer to the Supreme Entity aka God.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why the unnecessary prejudice towards Ketu? Well the fact that Ketu has its own agenda which is free from the social norms, rules and regulations makes it quite a villian for the society. The world is not known to welcome people who go against social norms. Most of people with Ketu in lagna or with <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a> in horoscope are detached from others and live a solitary life. They have a nihilistic, uncaring and unapologetic attitude towards society as a whole. They are meant to break away from the social bonds which bind the individuals to society. Some of them even resort to total reclusiveness from society in the form of Sanyas. Others less fortunate try to live a detached life while remaining in the society constantly at logger-heads with the cultural norms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets talk of the downside of Ketu in a bad placement for a bit. Ketu is the astrological equivalent word of detachment. Divorces, Separation from loved ones and Solitary Life would send quivers down anyone''s spine. As long as you live in this world ones self is bound to have inclinations towards socialisation, recognition, acceptence, affection and attraction. It is only natural to have these feelings. The greatest of the saints and holy souls desired for such comforts and pleasures. Now the person who lived in solitary confinement and emotional reclusiveness cannot just mix with the society like sugar in water. They would always stick out like a sore thumb. Eventually their desires fade away and they become even more reclusive and paranoid of the society. They loose purpose and motivation in their life. But fear not as Krishna said in the Gita:</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">"<em>One who walks on path towards knowledge and engages in auspicious activities does not meet his end.</em>" --Bhagvad Gita Chapter 6 Verse 40</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence here is person with a good Ketu is naturally detached and not interested in materialistic goals and social confirmity. That alone brings them closer to the Supreme Entity which is the final goal of all human beings. For them their own inner voice is final take on everything. As long as you don''t care about society it would be the highest blessing to have Ketu in lagna or with Chandra or have period of Ketu which brings separation from loved ones. For others who are bonded with society there is a solution to pray to Lord Ganesh to lessen the effects of a malefic Ketu.</p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-02-01 11:48:24', 899, '2014-03-06 08:26:01', '*', '2014-02-01 11:48:24', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 9, 97, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 8, 3, 1, 'ketu in vedic astrology, ketu in astrology, ketu in 12 bhavas, ketu in 12 rashi', 'ketu in vedic astrology', 10, '', 1);

In simpler terms the First House in a horoscope is the mirror to the individual whose horoscope is shown. The important thing to know is only a summary is possible through First House. The whole thesis of an individual requires lots of careful study of various factors including Chandra Lagna, Surya Lagna, Nakshatra Lords of Lagna and Chandra and last by not least the Lagnesha.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1st house ispart of Vishnu Sthanas as well as trine called Laxmi Sthanas. The physical attributes and complexion of individuals are based on rashi in lagna, lagnesha and also the nakshatra lords of lagna and lagnesha. The emotional characteristics of individual can be more accurately predicted using lagna, lagnesha and Chandra''s placement in horoscope and nakshatra lord of <a href="option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a>.

First House and lagnesha are also important factors to be considered to view health. Emotional picture of individual is better estimated from Chandra Lagna. Same way Surya Lagna is used to decipher the spiritual view of things.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each lagna/first house has a planetary lord which is known as lagnesha. The placement of lagnesha is also very important to be considered when talking about charecteristics, health, emotions and physical attributes. A troubled placement of lagnesha suggests a troubled individual while a favourable placement of lagnesha suggests success and happiness for individual. Whatever the result one could find his true self through First House and Lagnesha. The rashi charecteristics are also absorbed by First House. Say a Cancer in Lagna/First House at time of birth suggest a kind and caring person. His complexion is generally fairer compared to those around him.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ever find the need to discover youself using astrology then first house is a nice place to start. It provides a brief overview of you as a person. If you carefully study First House including Chandra Lagna, Surya Lagna, Nakshatra Lord of Lagna and Lagnesha as well as Rashi in First House you could solve the big jigsaw puzzle that is your characture and nature.

It defines your&nbsp;analytical&nbsp;mind, your intelligence, your ability to communicate with others but perhaps most important of all your equation with your immediate siblings and neighbors.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the age of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube 3rd house has practically become an over-night star. It has woken up from his slumber sleep to rise to new highs. Today your PR Skills and ability to highlight yourself has become an indispensable tool at business and at workplace. In the age of cut-throat competition your ability to sell yourself and your products is quite a reliable tool. Not only that a facebook profile, a tweet, a youtube video &amp; an instagram photo would probably fetch you a good income if it is worth it. Though the money may not necessarily come directly through them there are enough people who want a superstar in the required field to sell their brands. 3rd house also looks after negotiation and communication skills. A &nbsp;star campaigner who sells the products and procures a deal are a blessing for big companies. Most importantly 3rd house is the house of courage. In simpler terms the ability to stand up for the right thing and fearlessness during times of crisis is a boon from a good 3rd house.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3rd house also deals with analytical skills and scientific thinking. Most of the good mathematician and scientist who deal with reasoning and analytical processes have a good 3rd house along with lord of 3rd house. 3rd house deals with brothers/sisters and neighbors. Bad aspects or bad planets can cause problems with expression, reasoning powers, analytical skills, fights with neighbors and siblings. Neurological Disorders are also a result of a bad 3rd house. A weak 3rd house creates a frequent traveller who has to travel to short distances to earn his livelihood.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For many years 3rd house was considered trivial but during the current time it has gained a good deal of popularity. While it still doesn''t command the same respect from astrologers, it does seem to have gained acceptence &amp; admiration.

You have quite a good chance of winning a lottery, getting lucky at the casino, drawing huge returns from short-term trading. A politician or actor requires a good 5th house to be in constant limelight.

While it is not an alternate to pure love of 4th house, 5th house provides a good alternate in terms of attraction, lust and romance. While a graha such as Shukra or Chandra in occupancy, 5th house could ensure a love on scale of Romeo-Juliet, Heer-Ranjhaana or Anarkali-Salim. A graha like Rahu with <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6:shukra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shukra</a> or <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a> could provide a illicit relationship with many partners outside of wedlock in 5th house.

Children and matters related to children can be deciphered through 5th house and 5th house lord.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5th house represents both positive and negative aspects of life. It is the house of fame, fortune and knowledge but at the same time it is also a nesting place for drugs, illicit affairs and criminal activities. The planets rashi and placement of 5th house lord ultimately decide the choices in life that an individual is likely to undertake. Broadly speaking 5th house is great for people craving for materialistic life.

It gives a surprisingly clear insight on the matters and subjects where there are high chances of creating a debt.

The more hostile planets in hostile rashi the more chances of a person having enemies. Some maybe disguised as your friends and well-wishers. 6th house is the best bet to finding your enemies and ways to counter them.

That notion goes away once there is a transit of Shani or Ketu or aspect of Shani. Dreams are quite good while they lasts but when you wake up there is a harsh reality of being stuck in an unwanted relation for your whole life.

It causes tremendous transformation in lives of an individual which is generally not welcomed and regarded as adversity. People who get too comfortable in life with pace of life and surroundings find it difficult when faced with huge transformation both physical and mental required by 8th house. Of course 8th house just carries the mandate of karma which would lead the individual to a higher path. At the end of the day it is all a matter of perspective. Some consider transformation as painful while others consider it a blessing in disguise. According to a famous proverb- "One person''s funeral is another person''s bread". Counselors, Therapists, Lawyers, Escorts, Tax Department and Astrologers thrive on the 8th house and problems it creates.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8th house is the house of death. When, Where and How is the person likely to die can be known through 8th house and factors which affect the 8th house. While worrying about death is unadvised, one should avoid accidents or mishaps by carefully studying 8th house which can accurately describe adversities before they happen. 8th house also deals with inherited wealth and hidden fortune. If you are left with a huge fortune by your forefathers or just found a pot of gold while accidentally digging your house you could be rest assured there is a favorable 8th house. If you get hounded by IRS or get your dirty linens (Affairs, Scandals and Scams) shown to the public you can be rest assured there is a problematic 8th house or bad aspects over it. <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a> is the karaka for 8th house but not favorable in 8th house as it gives a bed ridden dependent life prior to slow and painful death. <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Mangal</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:surya&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Surya</a> both cause boils near your rectum and even sometimes account for cruel death through animals or weapons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A lot of matters of 8th house remain a mystery to astrology as people are not willing to discuss its matters openly.

Leaving that aside it is imperative that some secrets remain secrets and they are only told to trusted sources. 8th house is the house where cycle of birth and rebirth starts.

Dharma doesn''t necessarily equate to religion or religious activities. From a astrological point of view Dharma actually means duties and obligation that a person has to fulfill. As Shakespeare rightly put it- "The World is a stage and we are all actors". Everyone has to perform a specific task in the big machinery. 9th house is the place where one becomes aware of meaning of life but more importantly he becomes aware of his Dharma or Duty as a Person. Depending on planets and aspects a person may become religious, seek higher education, wander off to foreign lands and even try asceticism and divination. All of this are just to find the higher purpose in life.

Individuals who plan to settle abroad and live a happy life should have a favorable 9th house. Aspirants of higher studies also need to look at the 9th house and favorable aspects on it before applying for higher education. Any sort of association through planets or aspects with Vishnu Sthanas or Laxmi Sthanas is ideal for 9th house.

While the career of a person maybe defined by past life karma the actions in this life define his reputation and future karma. There is nothing to be worried about a job post or public standing. Instead focusing on doing the job with hard work and diligence is the right way to go about life.

As one of the hell houses it can literally put individuals through the motions and create depression and anxities of unparallel quantities. 12th house also rules over prisons, ashrams, hospitals and mental institutions. On a better note it also rules research and doctarate programmes. But the most important of all is that the 12th house provides Moksha to an individual.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No one likes matters of the 12th house. Who would want to voluntarily go to prisons, hospitals or mental institutions? Who would like depression grief, despair and losses? Impact of 12th house is huge and the tag of Valley of Despair is apt for matters of this house. But after careful observation and practical experience a hypothesis starts to develop that the 12th house is perhaps the most misunderstood house in astrology.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While not many people reading this article would care to get Moksha, it is essential to know that no rebirth equates to no suffering. For those who do not believe in the concept of Moksha, there is higher knowledge and deeper meaning of life associated with the 12th house. An individual gains an understanding of concepts which are outside the scope of what is already known. This is the reason why research and doctarate programmes are under the wings of the 12th house as these are fields where knowledge is not yet present in this world. For those who don''t care two hoots about Moksha or Knowldge there is the most important aspect called bed pleasures ruled by 12th house. Many marriages break on complaints of incomplete or no sexual satisfaction derived from partners. 12th house ascertains whether you have a good life in bed or not. Perhaps more importantly it guarantees that your marriage is not broken on account of non-existent physical relationship with your partner.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12th house on the positive side also rules dreams and imagination.

Believers and Non-Believers both like to argue endlessly over the benefits and flaws of astrology. Believers often say how future can be predicted from the stars and constellations and how one can benefit from knowing the future. Non-Believers would often quarrel how a man is the architect of his own fortune and stars, planets and constellations have no part in deciding fate of the man.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which of them stands right? I would say both of them are right in a way. A logical person will know that a person born in an under-developed country and working in a blue collar job cannot influence the thoughts and actions of whole world as say a person who is born in US and who is part of a political system in there. So isn''t it right to say that stars did favor the one born in US.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then again if everything was decided by stars and planets there would be no place for hard work and perseverance. There would be no Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi or Thomas Edison. Hard Work, Dedication, Perseverance, Dignity, Discipline, Diligence and Patience are key factors found in most successful men and women.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which one is it? The answer would be a mixture of both. Astrology is a science of predicting future events based on mathematical and astronomical calculations but that alone is not enough. Hard Work and Sincere Efforts also play a major role in deciding success or failure for an individual. This site would hopefully shed some light on the comman misconcepts and illusions regarding astrology.

Love starts with admiration, followed by attraction, followed by lust, followed by physical relationship and finally ends with contentment or dissolution. Ofcourse real love has no regrets or resentment and only wants the well being of the concerned love interest. But that love is unlikely barring a few yogas are in a horoscope. It wouldn''t be an exaggeration to say that majority of people who visit this site or article are not interested in love of that platonic level.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When you fall in love with someone it is only natural to have a desire to spend more time with him/her. When love happens to an individual they start to live in a different dimension and see things that would provide them bliss and happiness. Depending on <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6:shukra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shukra</a> or <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu''s</a> transits proximity between the two concerned individuals increases and desire to live with them through thick and thin of life starts to arise. During those happy times an individual feels nothing wrong with his partner and overlooks all of his/her flaws. Love shows a world which is full of hope and optimism. The concerned lover starts to enjoy and appreciate the blue skies above him and the colorful flowers around him. When they finally arise from their imagination land thanks to the transits of Mr. Reality Check called <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a> or Mr. Dissolution called <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9:ketu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Ketu</a> they see The Ugly Truth Of Relationship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While love is more of a privilege, relationship is more of a responsibility to stay together due to social norms. Everything is fine as long as you are in love but when that love disappears then you see the faults which you overlooked a long time ago. Suddenly the skies turn gray, sunshine is replaced by dark clouds and happiness is replaced by gloominess. All of a sudden lightning strikes his/her brain and he repents on how stupid he was to fall for the Relationship Trap. Bear in mind this is the critical point in life. Some individuals separate while other resourceful souls adapt and compromise while still staying together. The important thing to note is this is not due to any planetary yogas but through perseverance, satisfaction and compromise. This is the part where relationship changes from a duty to a privilege. Relationship is no longer a burden at this junction and becomes a relief to have been in a relation. Albeit this may take a lifetime to achieve and others quit and even try other alternatives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether you love a person, live in a relationship or have separated it is very important to understand that planetary combinations have a large say in it. While ultimately it is a choice of individuals the circumstances surrounding the choices are influenced by planets and past karma both good or bad.&nbsp;</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-03-24 07:08:16', 899, '2014-03-24 09:19:01', '*', '2014-03-24 06:09:55', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 72, 239, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 0, 3, 0, '', '', 19, '', 1),
(79, 'com_content.article', 'Shani and Superstition', 'shani-and-superstition', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As explained in the article <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a> it is unncessarily feared and usually his effects are blown out of proportions. There are a couple of odd superstitions related with Shani. It is a human tendency to feel anger, anguish and fear of things which we do not comprehend. But it is necessary to understand the cause of fear and worries to get a solution in life. Here are a couple of superstitions commonly associated with Shani which are dispelled through adequate reasoning. Furthermore the activities done or suggested to pacify Shani are also properly analyzed.</p>\r\n<p><strong style="font-size: 1em;">Superstition 1: Shani Saade Saati is always bad</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is the most unwarranted fear I''ve come across. As soon as a Saade-Saati starts people start to think that the next seven and half years of life would be hell. Some smart ones refer to an astrologer and decipher the effects of all 3 phases of two and half period to know which is the worst and which is favorable for them. Even the Jyotish instills unnecessary fear in the native and gives them wrong message.</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani Saade Saati is an excellent time to burn past life karma be it good or bad. It only gives back what you''ve given in the past life and this life before the Saade Saati began. Depending on your karma all 3 subperiods could be good like heaven or bad like hell. So just think of doing good karma and eventually nothing bad would happen. Ofcourse progress is stalled but that doesn''t mean you don''t get the fruits of your hard work ever.</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 2: Harsh Times go away by offering Oil to Shani and Lord Hanuman Idols</strong></h4>\r\n<p>This is another crazy theory propogated by astrologers and priest alike. Obviously they would make a fortune out of it so they would love to see more and more people coming to offer oil. Imagine a temple where everyone offers 100 ml of oil to the idols. Say 300 people come to the temple out of which 200 pour oil on the idol. That equates to 20 litre of oil being wasted on a Saturday alone. That are rough statistics for one temple. Say in India and abroad there are atleast 1000 temples of Lord Hanuman &amp; Shani. So Saturday amounts for 20,000 litres of oil wastage due to a stupid superstition. That oil could have been used to feed the poor, export to other countries or even cook for oneself (after all God resides in each and every soul)</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani is the karaka for Scarcity, Famine and Drought. Imagine you go to Sahara Desert and waste water in front of the native who resides there. You can imagine how angry he would be cause he has to struggle to get drinking water. Same way I can only imagine how mad Mr. Grandpa Shani would be by wastage of oil on idols. It is better to donate oil to a poor cause Shani is also a karaka for Poverty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Superstition 3: Shani Chalisa and Shani Prayers are needed to calm the effects of furious Shani</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I''ve seen people do religious mantra, superstitious activities and speak prayers of God and Gramps Shani all day long. While I am not against prayers of God, prayers to planet are not right in my opinion. They are just planets who follow a fix trajectory. They won''t change their trajectory for anyone. So why bother appeasing them?</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani couldn''t care less about appeasement cause he is a judge of people''s karma and he has to stay impartial and deliver due justice to the native. It doesn''t matter to him if you are a King or Servant, Rich or Poor, Religious or Non-Believer. I would suggest prayers to your favorite Gods once and to keep calm and continue to do your duties. That would be like a mercy plea in front of Judge Shani and he would oblidge and give mercy for sure.</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 4: Shani drishti is always bad</strong></h4>\r\n<p>These might not be totally false cause even the literatures on Shani propogate this theory. But what they also describe is Shani is the judge of one''s karma.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani gives results of past lives karma and that maybe an accumulation of many lives. Unless a native has done horrendous acts in his/her past lives it is not possible that horoscope houses which are aspected by Shani at birthtime keep on giving continuous bad results. What is necessary to know is Shani gives good or bad results to each house its transits or aspects when it moves in a Gochara Transit.</p>\r\n<p>In the end all I want to say is don''t fret about Shani like he is some relentless stalker or merciless killer. Just keep calm through periods of Shani and try to do your karma as effectively as you can. Understand that failures and disappointments are part and parcel of life and they help us stay grounded.</p>\r\n<p>Feel free to drop in a comment if you have any questions on the concerned article.</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-02-04 08:12:14', 899, '2014-03-24 07:48:49', '*', '2014-03-24 06:33:01', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 67, 242, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 0, 7, 0, '', '', 20, '', 1),
(80, 'com_content.article', 'Visha Yoga', 'visha-yoga', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visha Yoga is the combination of <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Shani</a>+<a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Chandra</a> in a horoscope. Visha means Poison and this yoga can act as poison in life of individual. This yoga generally occurs every 27 days as it takes 27 days for moon to complete its rotation of earth and navigate via the 12 Rashis in a horoscope. While this yoga is catastrophic for most, it has been shown that a few natives do rise above this bad placement and do wonders in their respective fields. Visha Yoga is also called as Nitrubhasha Yoga or Shani-Chandra yoga.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The very name Visha Yoga is enough to send jitters down the spine of many. If the angle between Shani and Chandra is less then 12 degrees than it is rest assured that these yoga would show you hell on earth. Imagine yourself being assigned to a prison where you are bound by chains and there is is a stern and relentless warden who beats with a whip at the slightest mistake. If you imagine the pain, fear and trauma you are close to understanding what Vish Yoga natives feel inside their head. Abeit it is the mind of the natives which makes a mountain out of mole hill but the trauma experienced is similar to lifetime sentence in a dark, lonely prison. &nbsp;However Vedic Astrology is a classic case of paradox. What is written is quite opposite of what is observed. Many Vish Yoga natives are quite successful in life and can even be great contributors to the society. However what is largely observed is these natives get very low returns for the substantial amount of efforts put in. Unless they work very hard it is difficult for them to achieve anything in life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To understand Vish Yoga well we need to understand the characteristics of the two planets which form the Vish Yoga. Shani known as Saturn is made up of poisonous gases among other substances. Chandra known as Moon is responsible for causing tides and ebbs in the ocean as well as liquid substance in body. In astrology Chandra is the karaka for mind. Shani poisons the mind of a native so the term <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Vish Yoga</span>&nbsp;</strong>is used. Digging deeper into the subject. Shani is the karaka for fear, oppression, scarcity, povery and hard work while Chandra is the karaka for emotions, unrequited love, affection and mother. Both of the planets are polar opposites in terms of personality and characteristics. When these two opposing planets combine in a horoscope they tend to constantly collide with each other on matters of ideologies. The mind of the native cannot make up whether he should guide his emotions or let emotions guide him. Naturally what follows is depression and despair- a typical trait of Vish Yoga natives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The picture is far more gloomy cause they may even become paranoid incapable of trusting others or believing in power of love. They are always physically tired and mentally exhausted. Often they attempt suicide but Shani would not let them take an escape route. Ofcourse some poor souls do use that option but that road is ill-advised for Vish Yoga natives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shani is a cruel planet and association with karaka of mind makes the mind become cruel as well. Many dicatator and oppressors have Vish Yoga in their horoscope. These yoga also creates an emotional oppressor and such natives have often been observed to oppress others or give pain and despair to others. If <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Mangal</a> is associated they may actually derive happiness from torturing and harassing others. If Guru is involved they could actually help others instead of harming and practise empathy.&nbsp;Vish Yoga natives are quite harsh in speech. If Mangal is associated with Shani-Chandra placement then natives are observed to be sarcastic also. However if a benefic <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a> is aspecting the house where Shani-Chandra placement occurs then effects are neutralized. If <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu</a> is present with Shani+Chandra then the effects are greatly increased and there is no way for native to recover. Generally any sort of association of Chandra, Shani and Rahu via aspect or placement suggests a life which is result of very bad karmas in past lives. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So how to tackle this difficult placement? It is not at all easy. Whether to choose mandate of duties and responsibilties given by Shani or whether to go with emotions, love and care bestowed by Chandra.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Solution: Get your horoscope analyzed by an astrologer. If Vish Yoga is in a friendly rashi or exaltion rashi of Chandra then go with emotions otherwise all other scenarios go for duties and responsibilities of Shani. As long as you take one of the path rest all should work out fine. No matter which path you take you would require concrete efforts (Shani) to get your objective. So whether you are looking to help the world (Chandra) or bend the world (Shani) you need to focus on that objective. Do not dwell too much on other things and you are bound to end up as success in life.</p>\r\n<p>Remedies: All solutions for Vish Yoga are useless without prayers to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is the remover of darkness and negativity, the drinker of poison and God of Knowledge. Recitation of ''Om Namah Shivay'' specifically in evening and night is advised when moon is present. Also prayers to Lord Jesus or Lord Vishnu or any of his avatar are advised. They are gods of compassion and love. They teach to love and help mankind.&nbsp;</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-03-24 11:10:58', 899, '2014-03-24 10:48:18', '*', '2014-03-24 10:14:40', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 74, 248, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 0, 6, 0, 'visha yoga, paapa kartari yogas, shani chandra yoga, nitrubhasha yoga', 'vish yoga description', 14, '', 1),
(81, 'com_content.article', 'Neech Bhanga Raja Yoga', 'nbry', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not much is said about Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga (NBRY) in traditional Vedic Astrology. It was later propogated by new age astrologers through case studies and experience. However what has largely been observed is there are valid reasons to believe that such yoga occurs in a horoscope. Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga is best explained by the story <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frog_Prince_(story)" target="_blank">Frog Prince</a> written by Grimm Brothers. Nothing in this world inspires people more then the underdog who fights all odds and wins. Rags to Riches story is an inspiration for all people who dream of similar fate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; NBRY in simple terms is a yoga which leads an underdog to perform above average deeds and acts. But for NBRY to occur a fundamental law is that the concerned person has to see humiliation and defeat in early part of life so much so that most of those around him start to question the native''s credentials. But these same humiliations and defeats are slowly but surely building the character of native. He starts to see things differently and sooner or later starts to find the ingredients which make him successful and renowned. Ofcourse to the outsiders who questioned him can never imagine that such a worthless scum could achieve unparalleled success so they merely pass it off as Got Lucky but for the native the story is different. He knows the hard work, sweat, patience and noble intentions he had to cultivate to reach that place among elites. In a way it can be said that the Neecha characteristics of the planet never goes away and such natives inspite of their position in life are always questioned by those around.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neecha Bhanga has some rules which are needed for its cancellation of neecha chracteristics. Some primary factors are mentioned below:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Neecha planet occupies the Vishnu Sthana or Laxmi Sthana from the Lagna or Chandra counted as Lagna.</li>\r\n<li>One of the co-tenants along with the neecha planet is an uccha planet or lord of the rashi (for eg. Guru in Makara Lagna along with Shani or Mangal as co-tenant)&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Neecha planet is retrograde (for eg. Retrograde Budh in Meena produces NBRY if Guru is located in Karka and native has Meena Lagna).&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>If the ruler of rashi of neecha planet is in kendra and in an uccha sthana or own rashi &nbsp;(for eg. Shani in Mesha would cause neecha bhanga if Mangal is in Makara)</li>\r\n<li>If the neecha planet is located in an uccha navamsha in Vishnu or Laxmi Sthana</li>\r\n<li>If the neecha planet has good Ashtvarga strength.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These are rough points and really there is actually a lot more to the equation. The term ''Neecha Bhanga'' actually differs from the term ''NBRY''. Neecha Bhanga is just the cancellation of neecha characteristics. In other words Neecha Bhanga leads person to lead a normal or above normal existence but does not have the capacity to turn a beggar into a king. Many people see Neecha Bhanga in their life cause one of the above equations is possible to be present in the horoscope. But NBRY has that capacity to turn dirt into gold. That rarely happens in my humble opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One way to know about NBRY is to check the above mentioned points for NBRY particularly the first four points, Afterwards try to honestly answer if you have found your higher purpose in life. As crazy as it sounds people with NBRY tend to live a life devoted to a fixed purpose and that purpose generally involves well-being of others. So if you are still restricted to personal well-being you are not ready to get the NBRY in your horoscope even if present. After all it is not easy to care for others who hurt you and make fun of you. When you learn to accept criticism with dignity and achieve patience, hope, faith and humility is the time when NBRY gives full fruit. More important then that is your purpose to do something in life which would benefit others. At that time even the Gods would bend down and give respect so how can planets be an exception.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-03-24 11:16:05', 899, '2014-03-24 10:50:17', '*', '2014-03-24 10:16:35', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 75, 250, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 0, 4, 0, 'neecha bhanga, neech bhang, neech bhanga, yogas for elevation', 'neech bhanga raja yoga description', 14, '', 1),
(82, 'com_content.article', 'Vipreeta Raja Yoga', 'vry', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vipreeta Raja Yoga like <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83:neech-bhanga&amp;catid=13:imp-yogas&amp;Itemid=113">NBRY</a>&nbsp;didn''t have much prominence in the early Vedic Astrology. But later in modern astrology these yogas have gained prominence. Vipreeta Raja Yoga (VRY) is a yoga formed when the lord of dushamsthanas are located in dushamsthanas. There are a host of rules for occurence or cancellation of these yoga which are discussed in details in this article.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first and foremost thing to understand is Vipreeta Raja Yoga is essentially a dushamsthana planet in a dushamsthana placement. In mathamatics two negatives always result in positive but in astrology it is not always the case though astrology is highly influenced by mathematics. Even if VRY occurs in life it actually take time before it gives fruition just like NBRY. Normally period of 36-42 years may already have passed before the circumstances turn Vipreeta or opposite to past and current bad scenario. Life is always ready to provide opportunities to individuals but the <a title="Prarabdha Article" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81:prarabdha&amp;catid=41:main-articles">Prarabdha</a> determines whether the concerned native would make the most of ray of hope provided or let it pass.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>First we would look at the various types of Vipreeta Raja Yoga</p>\r\n<p>1. Harsh Yoga: When lord of 12th house is in 6th house then Harsha Yoga is said to be formed. Some text mention lord of any dushamsthana house in 6th house gives rise to Harsh Yoga. This yoga makes a person fortunate, happy, invincible, strong, sturdy, wealthy and famous.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. Sarala Yoga: When lord of 8th house is located in 8th house then Sarala Yoga is formed. Some text say lord of any dushamsthana houses in 8th house causes Sarala Yoga. This yoga makes a person long-lived, fearless, happy, invincible, learned, a terror to his enemies, wealthy, famous, celebrated and prosperous.</p>\r\n<p>3. Vimala Yoga: When lord of the 6th house occupies the 12th house, Vimala Yoga is formed. Some text say lord of any dushamstahana in 12th house causes Vimala Yoga. This yoga makes a person independent, endowed with noble qualities, wealthy, happy and economical in spending.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are rules of cancellation of VRY which are mentioned below.</p>\r\n<p>1. The lord of Dushamsthana Houses is also a lord of Laxmi Sthanas</p>\r\n<p>2. When there is Parivartana Yoga between any of the Dushamsthana House Lords.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. Lords of 10th house or Laxmi Sthanas should not be present in the dushamsthana house where VRY occurs. For example: For Mithuna Lagna lord of house 6 is Mangal. If Mangal is located in 12th house then Vimala Yoga is formed. But if Guru or Budh is also present with Mangal in 12th house then the result of VRY won''t be obtained.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vipreeta Raja Yogas are too difficult to judge just like <a title="Neech Bhanga Raja Yoga Link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83:neech-bhanga&amp;catid=13:imp-yogas&amp;Itemid=113">NBRY</a>. Countless permutations and combinations have to be deciphered before coming to the right conclusion. What is generally observed is most of natives with a dushamsthana lord in dushamstha house are presented with some sort of help against the flow of circumstances. Some take that helping hand and do wonders in their life while others keep on looking for all the lights to turn green and they never do turn green. If you have a dushamsthana planet in a dushamsthana location the best thing to do is keep calm and work towards a fixed goal. When there is an opportunity presented that same calmness and previous efforts would give fruitful results.&nbsp;</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-03-24 11:19:43', 899, '2014-03-24 10:49:18', '*', '2014-03-24 10:21:21', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 76, 252, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 0, 3, 0, '', '', 14, '', 1);

(83, 'com_content.article', 'Vipra Chandal Yoga', 'vcy', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vipra Chandal Yoga (VCY) is the yoga formed when <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Guru</a> and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109">Rahu</a> combine together in the same house in a horoscope. It is also called Guru Chandal Yoga. This yoga generally arises when a native has insulted or wronged a honest, pious and spiritual soul in the past livesl.&nbsp;Vipra in Sanskrit means a brahmin or pious soul while Chandal means a ghastly, roaming and uncultured person. Guru is considered Vipra while Rahu is considered Chandal so the name Vipra Chandal Yoga. Ofcourse modern day interpretation of Rahu is quite different. Today Rahu represents the PR (Public Relations) Machine who can sell anything whether the product or person is worth the money or not. Alas! No matter how good the packaging is if the product isn''t nice then there are bound to be unhappy customers. Similar is the fate of modern day PR Machine called Rahu, Eventually people see through the deceit and cunningness and you can expect tomatoes, shoes and eggs being hurled at you if you go by Rahu''s fake PR.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every 7-8 years the smart, quiet, sensible, pious and religious Guru combines with the faker, poser, liar in Rahu and the problematic VCY is formed. When two opposing grahas combine in a horoscope house there are bound to be fights and struggles. In normal scenario two grahas located in one horoscope house start to get along after sometime and learn to adjust and accommodate each other. Sometimes they even compliment each other but when Rahu combines with any graha the opposite is true. Rahu is desire, lust and greed personified. Rahu may turn good and humble for few days but inner cravings and desire don''t go away. Sooner or later he resorts to illegal, unreligious and unethical activities to get the things he desires. The problem here is Guru is so religious and righteous that he cannot fathom illegal activities. So the cursed yoga called VCY or Guru Chandal Yoga is formed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When two or more grahas are in the same horoscope the strongest placement always wins and dictates terms for other grahas. So if Guru is strong in a &nbsp;horoscope then he would dictate terms and generally a good character, religious nature and honest individual is observed. But if Rahu is strong then person is drawn by immoral activities, is an athiest or fakes religion for personal gains and even resorts to illegal activities. Before judging the effects of Guru Chandal Yoga it is necessary to get your horoscope analysed and know the strength of Guru. Below are the effects of VCY in various houses:</p>\r\n<p><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10:tanu-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=114">1st House</a>: When VCY is formed in the 1st house the native begets an immoral character and is inclined to unethical deeds, unsocial desires and cravings. He maybe unapologetic and ungrateful to others. If VCY is formed with Guru in strong position then native maybe religious, kind hearted, learned and inclined to follow social norms.</p>\r\n<p><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11:dhana-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110">2nd House</a>: If Guru is not strong then native may have problems in speaking clearly and may even stammer or lisp.

One has to travel to foreign locations for religious purpose or to earn a living. But there is loss of savings and in some cases even legal cases and prison sentence possible if Guru is in bad position.</p>\r\n<p>Remedies for Vipra Chandal Yogas: Though there are countless remedies suggested the best remedy is to offer services (seva) to an elderly, teacher, guru or priestly person. This yoga occurs when a righteous person is insulted or wronged so it is only natural to correct that wrong by giving the right respect back to a righteous person. Prayers to Lord Dattatreya or chanting of Vishnu Sahasaranama are also advised. Try not to do any special poojas unless it is absolutely necessary. Focus on helping elderly and things would work out just fine.&nbsp;</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-03-24 11:22:09', 0, '2014-03-24 10:23:49', '*', '2014-03-24 10:22:32', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 77, 254, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 0, 3, 0, 'guru chandra yoga, vipra chandal yoga, guru chandal yoga, guru+rahu', 'guru chandal yoga description', 14, '', 1),

(94, 'com_content.article', 'Prarabdha', 'prarabdha', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Vedic Astrology there are concepts of Prarabdha and Purushartha. Prarabdha in English means Fate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Prarabdha of an individual plays a big part in shaping his life. If an individual is meant to rise from Rags to Riches then Prarabdha pushes him in that direction. If he is meant to fall down from a top position in life then Prarabdha pushes him in that direction. It all depends on karma of an individual or in other words Purushartha. To a believer of Prarabdha, fate controls the destiny while for a believer of Purushartha, hard work controls the destiny. Actually the reality is somewhere in the middle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prarabdha and Purushartha are not on collision course but rather run parallel and meet at some point of the road. The Purushartha of today becomes the Prarabdha of tomorrow. The Prarabdha faced today maybe a result of Purshartha of yesterday. Similarly today''s Prarabdha may decide the Purushartha for tomorrow. In astrological terms the placement and aspect of benefic planets like Guru, Shukra and Chandra drive the good Prarabdha while placement and aspect of malefic planets like Shani, Mangal, Rahu and Ketu suggest bad Prarabdha which befalls a native. But there is the quintessential question as to where should one apply Prarabdha and where should one apply Purushartha. Vedic Astrology and ancient Vedic Text suggests leaving matters of Artha Houses (2nd house, 6th house and 10th house) and Kama Houses (3rd house, 7th house and 11th house) to Prarabdha. Well to be more accurate leave matters of Savings, Popularity in Media, Matters of Debt, Marriage, Business Partnership (success or failure in partnership), Career Standing, Financial Gains and Quality and Quantity of Friends to Prarabdha. Not every matter in the concerned houses is better to leave to Prarabdha but knowing that Artha Houses and Kama Houses are driven by Prarabdha saves pain in future as they are beyond one''s control.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Kabir rightly said in his doha:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>“Manushya kadi balwaan nahi; Samaya sab se balwaan<br />Kaabe Arjuna lutiyo; Wahi dhanush wahi baan”</h4>\r\n<p>Translation: Time is far more powerful compared to the human. The greatest of the warrior Arjuna lost to a bunch of tribesman of forest even though he was using the same quiver and arrows which he used to defeat mighty warriors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Countless stories exist to justify Saint Kabir''s views. But the point put across is not to get arrogant or conceited if you find victory and not to get deflated and lose hope at loss. Accept your Prarabdha and work towards your Purushartha.&nbsp;</p>', 1, '', 0, 1, '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 899, '', '2014-03-25 12:35:27', 0, '2014-03-25 11:37:10', '*', '2014-03-25 11:35:50', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 87, 280, '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', 0, 3, 0, 'vedic astrology, fate in astrology, prarabdha in astrology, learn vedic astrology, vedic astrology tutorials', 'prarabdha in astrology', 19, '', 1),

It is the driving force and the foremost reason why astrology gets it wrong in terms of forecasting future of the native. Just like there are Variants, Pie Values, Friction and Worst Case Scenarios in Mathematics, Science and Programming which cause calculations to go awry there is Purushartha in astrology which puts all the calculations as meaningless and native achieves things which cannot be calculated at birth. This single word maligns astrology like no other one does yet this article is only meant to praise this nemesis called Purushartha cause it is truly a great nemesis.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Purushartha is nothing but hard work without any sort of expectations in return. The very essence of Bhagvad Gita can summarize Purushartha like no one else can:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;"One cannot achieve anything without doing Karma (Purushartha). Don''t try to get anything for free. No work is bereft of gains. One should not ever get depressed in life. One should not lose confidence while doing his Karma (Purushartha)." -- Pandurang Athvale</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Purushartha and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81:prarabdha&amp;catid=41:main-articles">Prarabdha</a> are not on collision course but run parellel and intersect at some point of the long road. So people who loathe fate and luck should not get agitated at those who believe in it and those who believe in fate and luck should understand that today''s hard work is tomorrow''s good luck. Some people are born with the knowledge of what Purushartha he needs to pursue to be successful in life. Generally they are the people who taunt everyone else with early success. What they fail to realize is that Prarabdha was responsible for making them pursue the respected field and gain success. By taunting others today''s bad karma would become bad Prarabdha for tomorrow and hit them hard on the face.&nbsp;In similar manner people who believe too much in luck and fate refuse to get out of their cocoon and work hard towards a fixed objective. What they fail to realize is today''s Purushartha would result in good karma and ultimately good Prarabdha in the future.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a dilemma in people when it comes to using Purushartha or &nbsp;applying Prarabdha.

To be more precise one should try hard for a good character, good health, good education, being religious as well try hard to get peace and happiness, think of death and rebirths and also work towards minimizing losses as well as gaining liberation from cycle of life and death by attaining Moksha.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Astrologers are generally not sought until situation is worse and all hope is lost. Some people are highly negative and consult astrologers to find out the right time to eat and sleep. What I personally advise is to learn about your Purushartha or goal of your life from astrologers as nothing is wrong in that. After that only visit him in times of calamity for solutions if possible through astrology. An honest astrologer is sure to give you right advise about the right course of action to take.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally don''t lose hope when all is lost and don''t get over the moon when you gain everything you''ve set out to do.

Believers and Non-Believers both like to argue endlessly over the benefits and flaws of astrology. Believers often say how future can be predicted from the stars and constellations and how one can benefit from knowing the future. Non-Believers would often quarrel how a man is the architect of his own fortune and stars, planets and constellations have no part in deciding fate of the man.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which of them stands right? I would say both of them are right in a way. A logical person will know that a person born in an under-developed country and working in a blue collar job cannot influence the thoughts and actions of whole world as say a person who is born in US and who is part of a political system in there. So isn''t it right to say that stars did favor the one born in US.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then again if everything was decided by stars and planets there would be no place for hard work and perseverance. There would be no Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi or Thomas Edison. Hard Work, Dedication, Perseverance, Dignity, Discipline, Diligence and Patience are key factors found in most successful men and women.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which one is it? The answer would be a mixture of both. Astrology is a science of predicting future events based on mathematical and astronomical calculations but that alone is not enough. Hard Work and Sincere Efforts also play a major role in deciding success or failure for an individual. This site would hopefully shed some light on the comman misconcepts and illusions regarding astrology. It will hopefully help individuals to decide where to apply the Prarabdha (Fate) and where to apply Purusharth (Hard Work).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"19","created":"2014-02-02 02:48:01","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-02-02 03:41:55","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-02-02 03:41:42","publish_up":"2014-02-02 02:48:01","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":2,"ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0);

It is the karaka for soul which is considered a part of God or God itselt. Not only that Surya is responsible for health, fame and leadership roles. Surya is also a karaka for father. Our eyes which let us see this beautiful world are governed by Surya as well. It is a male planet, royalty in nature and is given the title of King among planets.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Surya is the king and leadership skills come naturally to those with good placement for Surya, ideally the 10th house. Many great politicians and leaders have Surya in an important placement in the horoscope. People with positive Surya in a horoscope show poise, confidence and firm determination. They rise to the status of a leader and an able administrator. People with a good Surya can be quite successful in the areas of agriculture and administration. Goverment jobs which provide a sense of security and stability are very likely due to a good Surya in a horoscope. Even if Surya is in <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28:tula&amp;catid=11:12-signs&amp;Itemid=111\\">libra<\\/a> which is its neecha rashi, provided it causes a neecha bhanga you are sure to see the concerned individual in a very important administrative or political role. Bear in mind they rarely get the top position if Surya is indeed in libra. Health, Vigour and Vitality all improve if Surya is in a good placement in a horoscope. With Budh as a co-tenant in a good sign or house, a very powerful yoga called Budh-Adidya Yoga is formed. It provides wealth, fame and prosperity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are downsides to any planet and Surya is no different. While a positive sun is a boon for individuals it is a curse for those around him. Surya is arrogant and inconsiderate to other people''s needs. In popular stories Surya is the father and <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Shani<\\/a> is the son yet they both don''t get along well. This is partly down to the autocratic and dictatorial nature of Surya the father and unapologetic and rigid nature of Shani the son. Families where father and children don''t get along well are sure to have Surya-Shani relationship in one way or the other. Surya influenced people generally get high positions and they are sure to push everyone to work beyond their possible limit which maybe fortunate for the enterprises but not so fortunate for the employees. Well surely they don''t become Mr. Popular with the minions yet they are sure to get special accolades from their bosses. In terms of health a bad placement of Surya is sure to give you several ailments, weak body and low confidence but a strong placement gives over-confidence in ones abilities and ultimately that causes their downfall. Burns and Boils also happen if Surya is in a fiery sign.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The problem with people who have a good Surya is they act confident and ambitious and shine a little too much for others to feel jealousy and insecurity. People often confuse their confidence for arrogance and their ambitions for egocentric behavior. They do not help their own cause either by being insensitive to those less confident and successful souls. &nbsp;Not everyone can become successful in life cause if everyone becomes a king then who will be the subjects? This trivial matter is too hard for people with good placement of Surya to understand. While the benefits of a good Surya are great as it gives authority, fame and health one must care not to be over-confident and forget kindness and empathy.<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:43:52","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-02-03 13:14:57","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-02-03 13:14:44","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:43:52","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":2,"ordering":"8","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

It is a karaka for mind and everything related to it. Moon also affects the blood circulation as well as water portions on the body and on earth. Well that implies nearly 70% of body and of earth are affected by Chandra. Chandra maybe a small planet and it only stays in a rashi for 2.5 days but its implications are huge when you take the co-tenants, rashi and house lords into consideration. Chandra brings tides and ebbs in an ocean and similarly it brings tides and ebbs in a human mind also. Every positive or negative, good or evil, happy or sad, nice or bad thought that comes to an individual is thanks to chandra and associations and afflictions to chandra. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moon is the closest planet to the earth. Theoretically it is a satellite. Just like satellites are responsible for good and bad signals in a television; Chandra is responsible for good and bad thoughts in an individual. <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Shani<\\/a> and <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Rahu<\\/a> association with Chandra is a prime factor for people with weak or malefic thought process. Of course the rashi occupied by Chandra also plays an important role in shaping the thought process of an individual.

Though bear in mind it is not always the case.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is highly impressionable graha. It quickly takes in the qualities of its rashi, co-tenants and grahas which aspect it.&nbsp;Lets talk in more detail about Chandra and associations with other planets.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Surya is called as Amavasya or No Moon. Many astrologers and jyotishis push the panic button once they hear of this scenario. Various havans, poojas and rings are provided to calm these so called horrible scenario. Well the truth couldn''t be farther off. Well Surya is soul and Chandra is the mind and it wouldn''t be so bad if soul and mind become one considering that soul is considered part of god and mind is the most definiting part in an invidual.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Mangal is considered auspicious by many astrologers cause it gives abundant wealth. That is partly true but they forget to mention that this association gives rise to a wounded warrior who is always there to take revenge on others.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Budh is probably among the worst. Most mental disorders are caused by this association. Chandra controls the mind while Budh takes care of nervous system. Not to mention this association causes an individual to be a chatter box.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association to Guru is probably the best. In a favourable rashi it causes a powerful yoga called Gaja Kesari yoga. It gives abundant wealth, happiness and prosperity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Shukra is also good. It provides abundant love. Most of the romeo-juliet stories are thanks to Chandra-Shukra association. The fairest and most beautiful looking individuals both male and female are very likely to have assocation of Chandra with Shukra.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Shani causes Vish Yoga. The mind is constantly in thinking process and nothing comes out of tireless thinking but sadness and worries. Depression is one of the possible scenarious with Shani-Chandra association. But people who learn to control their emotions and adapt to difficulties and changing scenarios become great individuals but that doesn''t come without a struggle.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra with Rahu is bad in general terms. Rahu is cloudy and smokey and causes disruption to natural though process. Simply speaking this association clouds judgement of an individual.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Ketu is bad for some and good for some. Ketu is the planet of detachment. Well for those who want to get closer to the god; this placement provides the right tools of obtaining that goal. For those who are too caught up with materialistic success; consider this placement to quite a bother and probably arrange for some counter measures.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is very small but its implications on human beings are pretty big. It alone is a gentle, calm and caring graha but depending on rashi lordship or co-tenants it could bring peace or havoc in your life.

A Mangal Dosha is a tragedy for the bride\\/groom and their parents yet a boon for the astrologers. No one is bothered to know that the very word \\"Mangal\\" means good and auspicious. Ofcourse mars is a fiery planet and has his sort of problems associated with itself but it is better to understand why this fiery planet is so angry and cold before making any judgement on people who are influenced very highly by this planet.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal is considered a male planet. To be more precise people born under the infuence of mars are the macho types. These includes females also. The ladies who like to order, shout and get angry to get things done are mostly under the influence of a strong mars in horoscope. Mars has a lot of high octane energy. People under the influence of Mars keep on doing relentless work, want everything on time, get angry at smallest inaccuracies of co-workers or employees and worst of all keep others on their toes. Mars hates laziness and lies. These are the reasons why they are the ideal employees but not-so great employers. Mangal is least likely to cause downfall of others. They may get angry, make enemies, use harsh speech but they rarely ever keep enemity for lives. They may get angry very fast but their anger also calms down after some time. But none the less Mangal does have its share of handicaps.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mangal is impatient and very harsh in speech. People under influence of Mars often make rash decisions and make enemies out of people due to their high moral values and principles. The world is not so honest and sincere. It is full of scums and leeches who thrive on looting and cheating others. Since Mangal cannot stand these things he is always at logger-heads with these people. A bride or groom who has Mangal in a prominent position cannot compromise on his\\/her ideals and principles. That is why a lot of quarrels happen and eventually divorces happen. Ofcourse astrologers do not help the cause by matching partners with Mars or <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Shani<\\/a>&nbsp;in a prominent position of the partner.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; None the less Mars does have its good side. Mars influence people easily sacrifice their own goodwill for people for whom they care. They would give up their profit for others to avoid loss. If any sort of association with Jupiter is present they could even bear loss if those they care for are profited from their sacrifice.&nbsp;Most of the prominent actors, sportsperson, celebrities and good army commanders have Mars in a very good position. Mars influence people do great in places where everything needs to be done on time like railways and armies. They make very competent lawyers and deal makers.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; In my view some people are born for the benefit of the community. They are there to make a difference. Mars influenced people are one of them. They may not be the most charming people to stay around but they are the most trustworthy, hard working and kind hearted people to be friends with.&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:45:23","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-02-03 13:17:36","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-02-03 13:17:20","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:45:23","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":2,"ordering":"6","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Budh is young, talkative and smart. Budh is generally very close to Surya in a horoscope with maximum distance being 28 degrees from each other. Budh provides common sense, speech, communicative skills and also commands the neural processes in the brain. Budh and Guru are almost identical in that both are scholars but in present scenarios the smart and argumentative Budh wins over the knowledgable but dignified Guru. Budh takes the qualities of its co-tenants easily be it good or bad. It is a very impressionable graha. Though Budh doesn''t see most planets as enemies other then Chandra, many see him as their enemy.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this age of PR those who can market themselves get more brownie points over others. Thanks to Budh you can effectively communicate your point across to others be it via speech or via writing. Most of the scientific research and innovations are possible due to the ideas and itellact provided by Budh. Be warned that plain old Budh is nothing but sweet talk. It needs a driver to put argument into efforts and theories into practise. Grahas like Mangal, Shani and Surya''s association with Budh are the drivers behind most important inventions. Budh is a businessman or more precisely a sales man. He can sweet talk anybody into buying a product be it good or bad. Most effecient salesman, call centre operatives, shop keepers and marketers need a good Budh for success in their fields. Those who have a weak Budh may suffer from speech defects, bad communicative skills as well as mental disorders.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budh is a very impressionable graha. Like Chandra it takes the qualities of its rashi, house and co-tenants very easily. A plain old Budh rarely makes or breaks a person. With planet Surya as its co-tenant a very powerful yoga is formed known as Budh-Aditya yoga which provides knowledge, wealth and heppiness. Though not everyone gets the benefit of Budh-Aditya yoga. Association of Budh+Mangal is difficult to judge. Sometimes this association causes catostrophe because Budh is calm while Mangal is restless. Two opposing forces staying in a rashi would provide disaster. But there are times when Budh provides direction to the abundant energy of Mangal. Many great individuals have a favorable association of Budh+Mangal. Many successful lawyers have Budh+Mangal relationship in their horoscope. Budh+Guru is a favorable association by and large. Guru''s knowledge is supported by Budh''s analytical, communicative and argumentative skills. In not so favourable location you could see a thug who uses his knowledge and speech to cheat others. Either way you are guaranteed to see a smart and successful individual when Budh+Guru is there in a horoscope. Budh+Shukra is also a very good combination. Musicians and Artists are likely to have association of Mangal+Budh. Budh+Shani provides good Mathematicians and Chartered Accountants.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budh is royalty by nature and more importantly royalty without duties. So you can''t expect Budh to understand problems or do proactive work or go out of his way to help others. Budh articulate and refined speech are sure to win over a few people, but long term they are bound to see that he is nothing but trash talk. Budh''s association with Mangal, Shani or Surya in a favorable location provides great results for individual as well as the community.<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:46:04","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-02-03 13:17:56","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-02-03 13:17:49","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:46:04","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":2,"ordering":"5","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Though we may not be aware of these crimes, gramps Shani keeps a watchful eye over these karmas. Remember, he cannot punish you unless you have done some crime. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\r\\n&nbsp; &nbsp;So why the fear of gramps Shani? Well, we are human beings after all. We cannot fathom why we need patience, hard work and discipline while the other guy gets the ferraris, the beautiful mansions and the iPhones. The sooner we learn the need for discipline, hard work, patience, fortitude and empathy the sooner does gramps Shani move out of our way. He does give wonderful results to those who plan the long road to success with honest and sincere efforts and plan betterment of the community and world. But those good fruits take a long, long time to come. By that time your patience is tested to the limits and your ego and arrogance is washed away. You are new and renewed all dignified, kind and considerate to your fellow beings.\\r\\n&nbsp; &nbsp;So is gramps Shani good or bad? Well he is bad cause we often plan shortcuts in life and easy way out of misery and suffering. That is the sole reason why Shani makes our lives a miserable hell. Say you are a prisoner in a jail and the warden catches you &nbsp;trying to sneak out of jail before your sentence is over. Most of us would assume that the warden would be very upset and may sentence us to more severe punishment. Same thing applies to Shani but he actually cares for his prisoners and wants them to be contributing members of the society. We do not like Shani cause he is a strict teacher who likes to whip now and then to teach some discipline and hard work to his students. No one likes to learn the things the hard way so to speak.\\r\\n&nbsp; Having said all this Shani has positive aspects in life also. Most of the guys who grow from rags to riches have Shani in an important disposition in their horoscope. Most of the people who make a difference in lives of others have Shani in exalted or own sign or in a good position. Shani destroys everything that is not sustainable over a long period of time. That includes relationships. Most of the divorces happen during the Saade-Saati or Shani Periods. Though it may seem like hell at that time after some time we come to realise that the relationship couldn''t have worked out and what happened was for the better. Our ego is destroyed and we learn the importance of patience and dignity. At the end of saade-saati most people develop a positive outlook towards lives.&nbsp;\\r\\n&nbsp; At the end of the day it all comes down to perspective. A simple, easy-going life is a choice of most but attainable by few. Those who believe in making lemonade, when lemons are provided fare much better in life then those who cry while looking at the lemons. Success is not defined by how high a person rises but how many times a person gets up after falling.&nbsp;\\r\\n","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:47:34","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-02-03 13:20:53","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-02-03 13:20:44","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:47:34","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":2,"ordering":"2","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

It is also termed as a dragon''s head in some places while in vedic astrology Rahu has the head of a snake. According to vedic astrology, Rahu is responsible for causing eclipse to Sun and the Moon. Rahu is &nbsp;smokey and mysterious. He represents black arts, magic, taboo activities and foreigners. Rahu is an impersonator who tries to show the qualities he does not have. He is considered a malefic planet and astrologers make quite a fortune out of the so-called bad yogas associated with it. Well, the truth couldn''t be further off.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rahu is a planet in vedic astrology and like in all planet''s case certain rules and regulations apply. The placement of Rahu at time of birth is fixed according to previous life karmas. Rahu is the most accurate measure to judge the sins of previous life karmas depending on his placement in horoscope along with its drishti. Rahu carries the mandate of putting a human being under illusion. Rahu encourages individuals to take risky and foolish decisions which only bring harm and loss for him. Ofcourse, sometimes it gives quite favorable results for people interested in forbidden desires and&nbsp;taboo activites. Not only that money, power, sex and fame are also abundant in a favorable period of Rahu.&nbsp;Most politicians have a very good Rahu. Rahu is a karaka for foreigners and everything mysterious. Rahu is one of the planets which in a favorable position can suggest a successful chance of going and settling abroad. Rahu in 4th house, 9th house and 12th house suggests if individual will live and stay away from home and in foreign locations.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rahu magnifies the bad effects and lessens the good effects of planet which is its co-tenant. It is generally favorable if Rahu is alone in a house with no co-tenants and not casting drishti on any planet. Rahu causes eclipse to the Sun and the Moon. In other words the intelligence and rational thinking are hindered due to Rahu. Bad decisions, tough luck and mental problems follow.

It is a malefic planet but that does mean it is literally bad. The facts about Ketu are often misinterpreted to suit the worldy desires so much so that it has lost its divine purpose. Ketu is capable of taking an individual closer to moksha. Only <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Guru<\\/a> is the other planet which can boasts of this great feat.

Well the fact that Ketu has its own agenda which is free from the social norms, rules and regulations makes it quite a villian for the society. The world is not known to welcome people who go against social norms. Most of people with Ketu in lagna or with <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Chandra<\\/a> in horoscope are detached from others and live a solitary life. They have a nihilistic, uncaring and unapologetic attitude towards society as a whole. They are meant to break away from the social bonds which bind the individuals to society. Some of them even resort to total reclusiveness from society in the form of Sanyas. Others less fortunate try to live a detached life while remaining in the society constantly at logger-heads with the cultural norms.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets talk of the downside of Ketu in a bad placement for a bit. Ketu is the astrological equivalent word of detachment. Divorces, Separation from loved ones and Solitary Life would send quivers down anyone''s spine. As long as you live in this world ones self is bound to have inclinations towards socialisation, recognition, acceptence, affection and attraction. It is only natural to have these feelings. The greatest of the saints and holy souls desired for such comforts and pleasures. Now the person who lived in solitary confinement and emotional reclusiveness cannot just mix with the society like sugar in water. They would always stick out like a sore thumb. Eventually their desires fade away and they become even more reclusive and paranoid of the society. They loose purpose and motivation in their life. But fear not as Krishna said in the Gita:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: left;\\">\\"<em>One who walks on path towards knowledge and engages in auspicious activities does not meet his end.<\\/em>\\" --Bhagvad Gita Chapter 6 Verse 40<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence here is person with a good Ketu is naturally detached and not interested in materialistic goals and social confirmity. That alone brings them closer to the Supreme Entity which is the final goal of all human beings. For them their own inner voice is final take on everything. As long as you don''t care about society it would be the highest blessing to have Ketu in lagna or with Chandra or have period of Ketu which brings separation from loved ones. For others who are bonded with society there is a solution to pray to Lord Ganesh to lessen the effects of a malefic Ketu.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\\"color: #000000;\\">&nbsp;<\\/span><\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:48:24","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-02-03 13:21:48","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-02-03 13:21:27","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:48:24","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":2,"ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

House of Marriage (first marriage), 7th house is practically the most popular house of the 12 houses of astrology.

Planets located in the 7th house are generally undesirable as they cause delay or divorce. A problematic 7th house could guarantee legal cases.

That notion goes away once there is a transit of Shani or Ketu or aspect of Shani. Dreams are quite good while they lasts but when you wake up there is a harsh reality of being stuck in an unwanted relation for your whole life.

It is the house which gives grief, despair and losses to an individual. Losses are not just monetary but also emotional and physical. As one of the hell houses it can literally put individuals through the motions and create depression and anxities of unparallel quantities. 12th house also rules over prisons, ashrams, hospitals and mental institutions.

Who would want to voluntarily go to prisons, hospitals or mental institutions? Who would like depression grief, despair and losses? Impact of 12th house is huge and the tag of Valley of Despair is apt for matters of this house. But after careful observation and practical experience a hypothesis starts to develop that the 12th house is perhaps the most misunderstood house in astrology.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While not many people reading this article would care to get Moksha, it is essential to know that no rebirth equates to no suffering. For those who do not believe in the concept of Moksha, there is higher knowledge and deeper meaning of life associated with the 12th house. An individual gains an understanding of concepts which are outside the scope of what is already known. This is the reason why research and doctarate programmes are under the wings of the 12th house as these are fields where knowledge is not yet present in this world. For those who don''t care two hoots about Moksha or Knowldge there is the most important aspect called bed pleasures ruled by 12th house. Many marriages break on complaints of incomplete or no sexual satisfaction derived from partners. 12th house ascertains whether you have a good life in bed or not. Perhaps more importantly it guarantees that your marriage is not broken on account of non-existent physical relationship with your partner.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12th house on the positive side also rules dreams and imagination.

Believers and Non-Believers both like to argue endlessly over the benefits and flaws of astrology. Believers often say how future can be predicted from the stars and constellations and how one can benefit from knowing the future. Non-Believers would often quarrel how a man is the architect of his own fortune and stars, planets and constellations have no part in deciding fate of the man.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which of them stands right? I would say both of them are right in a way. A logical person will know that a person born in an under-developed country and working in a blue collar job cannot influence the thoughts and actions of whole world as say a person who is born in US and who is part of a political system in there. So isn''t it right to say that stars did favor the one born in US.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then again if everything was decided by stars and planets there would be no place for hard work and perseverance. There would be no Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi or Thomas Edison. Hard Work, Dedication, Perseverance, Dignity, Discipline, Diligence and Patience are key factors found in most successful men and women.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which one is it? The answer would be a mixture of both. Astrology is a science of predicting future events based on mathematical and astronomical calculations but that alone is not enough. Hard Work and Sincere Efforts also play a major role in deciding success or failure for an individual. This site would hopefully shed some light on the comman misconcepts and illusions regarding astrology. It will hopefully help individuals to decide where to apply the Prarabdha (Fate) and where to apply Purusharth (Hard Work).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"19","created":"2014-02-02 02:48:01","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-02-12 05:04:43","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-02-12 05:02:51","publish_up":"2014-02-02 02:48:01","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"0\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":5,"ordering":"2","metakey":"vedic astrology, prarabdha, purushartha","metadesc":"main article on vedic astrology","access":"1","hits":"4","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Believers and Non-Believers both like to argue endlessly over the benefits and flaws of astrology. Believers often say how future can be predicted from the stars and constellations and how one can benefit from knowing the future. Non-Believers would often quarrel how a man is the architect of his own fortune and stars, planets and constellations have no part in deciding fate of the man.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which of them stands right? I would say both of them are right in a way. A logical person will know that a person born in an under-developed country and working in a blue collar job cannot influence the thoughts and actions of whole world as say a person who is born in US and who is part of a political system in there. So isn''t it right to say that stars did favor the one born in US.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then again if everything was decided by stars and planets there would be no place for hard work and perseverance. There would be no Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi or Thomas Edison. Hard Work, Dedication, Perseverance, Dignity, Discipline, Diligence and Patience are key factors found in most successful men and women.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which one is it? The answer would be a mixture of both. Astrology is a science of predicting future events based on mathematical and astronomical calculations but that alone is not enough. Hard Work and Sincere Efforts also play a major role in deciding success or failure for an individual. This site would hopefully shed some light on the comman misconcepts and illusions regarding astrology. It will hopefully help individuals to decide where to apply the Prarabdha (Fate) and where to apply Purusharth (Hard Work).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: justify; color: black;\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"19","created":"2014-02-02 02:48:01","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-02-17 06:11:44","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-02-17 06:11:08","publish_up":"2014-02-02 02:48:01","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"0\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"0\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":6,"ordering":"2","metakey":"vedic astrology, prarabdha, purushartha","metadesc":"main article on vedic astrology","access":"1","hits":"4","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

The only difference is Politicians dirties the system while the Sweeper cleans it. So who is more important of the two? You can take a good guess as to who would be approved by people and the maker aka God. While the career of a person maybe defined by past life karma the actions in this life define his reputation and future karma. There is nothing to be worried about a job post or public standing. Instead focusing on doing the job with hard work and diligence is the right way to go about life. Regretfully myself included most people worry about their line of work and position more then the quality of work, satisfaction that comes with it and the output delivered to the society.&nbsp;10th house is also called Pitru Bhava or Father''s House. Father''s character and personality as well as relationship with child can be known through 10th house. Devil-in-disguise known as the Boss as well as familiar foe called Mother-in-Law are also governed by the 10h house.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10th house deals with leadership qualities, administration, father and political ambitions.

While the career of a person maybe defined by past life karma the actions in this life define his reputation and future karma. There is nothing to be worried about a job post or public standing. Instead focusing on doing the job with hard work and diligence is the right way to go about life. Regretfully myself included most people worry about their line of work and position more then the quality of work, satisfaction that comes with it and the output delivered to the society.&nbsp;10th house is also called Pitru Bhava or Father''s House.

It is the karaka for soul which is considered a part of God or God itselt. Not only that Surya is responsible for health, fame and leadership roles. Surya is also a karaka for father. Our eyes which let us see this beautiful world are governed by Surya as well. It is a male planet, royalty in nature and is given the title of King among planets.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Surya is the king and leadership skills come naturally to those with good placement for Surya, ideally the 10th house. Many great politicians and leaders have Surya in an important placement in the horoscope. People with positive Surya in a horoscope show poise, confidence and firm determination. They rise to the status of a leader and an able administrator. People with a good Surya can be quite successful in the areas of agriculture and administration. Goverment jobs which provide a sense of security and stability are very likely due to a good Surya in a horoscope. Even if Surya is in <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28:tula&amp;catid=11:12-signs&amp;Itemid=111\\">libra<\\/a> which is its neecha rashi, provided it causes a neecha bhanga you are sure to see the concerned individual in a very important administrative or political role. Bear in mind they rarely get the top position if Surya is indeed in libra. Health, Vigour and Vitality all improve if Surya is in a good placement in a horoscope. With Budh as a co-tenant in a good sign or house, a very powerful yoga called Budh-Adidya Yoga is formed. It provides wealth, fame and prosperity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are downsides to any planet and Surya is no different. While a positive sun is a boon for individuals it is a curse for those around him. Surya is arrogant and inconsiderate to other people''s needs. In popular stories Surya is the father and <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Shani<\\/a> is the son yet they both don''t get along well. This is partly down to the autocratic and dictatorial nature of Surya the father and unapologetic and rigid nature of Shani the son. Families where father and children don''t get along well are sure to have Surya-Shani relationship in one way or the other. Surya influenced people generally get high positions and they are sure to push everyone to work beyond their possible limit which maybe fortunate for the enterprises but not so fortunate for the employees. Well surely they don''t become Mr. Popular with the minions yet they are sure to get special accolades from their bosses. In terms of health a bad placement of Surya is sure to give you several ailments, weak body and low confidence but a strong placement gives over-confidence in ones abilities and ultimately that causes their downfall. Burns and Boils also happen if Surya is in a fiery sign.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The problem with people who have a good Surya is they act confident and ambitious and shine a little too much for others to feel jealousy and insecurity. People often confuse their confidence for arrogance and their ambitions for egocentric behavior. They do not help their own cause either by being insensitive to those less confident and successful souls. &nbsp;Not everyone can become successful in life cause if everyone becomes a king then who will be the subjects? This trivial matter is too hard for people with good placement of Surya to understand. While the benefits of a good Surya are great as it gives authority, fame and health one must care not to be over-confident and forget kindness and empathy.<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:43:52","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-06 06:53:36","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-06 06:49:05","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:43:52","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"9","metakey":"surya in astrology, surya in vedic astrology, surya in 12 rashi, surya in 12 bhava","metadesc":"Surya in Vedic Astrology","access":"1","hits":"4","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

It is a karaka for mind and everything related to it. Moon also affects the blood circulation as well as water portions on the body and on earth. Well that implies nearly 70% of body and of earth are affected by Chandra. Chandra maybe a small planet and it only stays in a rashi for 2.5 days but its implications are huge when you take the co-tenants, rashi and house lords into consideration. Chandra brings tides and ebbs in an ocean and similarly it brings tides and ebbs in a human mind also. Every positive or negative, good or evil, happy or sad, nice or bad thought that comes to an individual is thanks to chandra and associations and afflictions to chandra.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moon is the closest planet to the earth.

Of course the rashi occupied by Chandra also plays an important role in shaping the thought process of an individual.

Though bear in mind it is not always the case.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is highly impressionable graha. It quickly takes in the qualities of its rashi, co-tenants and grahas which aspect it.&nbsp;Lets talk in more detail about Chandra and associations with other planets.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Surya is called as Amavasya or No Moon. Many astrologers and jyotishis push the panic button once they hear of this scenario. Various havans, poojas and rings are provided to calm these so called horrible scenario. Well the truth couldn''t be farther off. Well Surya is soul and Chandra is the mind and it wouldn''t be so bad if soul and mind become one considering that soul is considered part of god and mind is the most definiting part in an invidual.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Mangal is considered auspicious by many astrologers cause it gives abundant wealth. That is partly true but they forget to mention that this association gives rise to a wounded warrior who is always there to take revenge on others.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Budh is probably among the worst. Most mental disorders are caused by this association. Chandra controls the mind while Budh takes care of nervous system. Not to mention this association causes an individual to be a chatter box.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association to Guru is probably the best. In a favourable rashi it causes a powerful yoga called Gaja Kesari yoga. It gives abundant wealth, happiness and prosperity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Shukra is also good. It provides abundant love. Most of the romeo-juliet stories are thanks to Chandra-Shukra association. The fairest and most beautiful looking individuals both male and female are very likely to have assocation of Chandra with Shukra.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Shani causes Vish Yoga. The mind is constantly in thinking process and nothing comes out of tireless thinking but sadness and worries. Depression is one of the possible scenarious with Shani-Chandra association. But people who learn to control their emotions and adapt to difficulties and changing scenarios become great individuals but that doesn''t come without a struggle.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra with Rahu is bad in general terms. Rahu is cloudy and smokey and causes disruption to natural though process. Simply speaking this association clouds judgement of an individual.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Ketu is bad for some and good for some. Ketu is the planet of detachment. Well for those who want to get closer to the god; this placement provides the right tools of obtaining that goal. For those who are too caught up with materialistic success; consider this placement to quite a bother and probably arrange for some counter measures.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is very small but its implications on human beings are pretty big. It alone is a gentle, calm and caring graha but depending on rashi lordship or co-tenants it could bring peace or havoc in your life.

A Mangal Dosha is a tragedy for the bride\\/groom and their parents yet a boon for the astrologers. No one is bothered to know that the very word \\"Mangal\\" means good and auspicious. Ofcourse mars is a fiery planet and has his sort of problems associated with itself but it is better to understand why this fiery planet is so angry and cold before making any judgement on people who are influenced very highly by this planet.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal is considered a male planet. To be more precise people born under the infuence of mars are the macho types. These includes females also. The ladies who like to order, shout and get angry to get things done are mostly under the influence of a strong mars in horoscope. Mars has a lot of high octane energy. People under the influence of Mars keep on doing relentless work, want everything on time, get angry at smallest inaccuracies of co-workers or employees and worst of all keep others on their toes. Mars hates laziness and lies. These are the reasons why they are the ideal employees but not-so great employers. Mangal is least likely to cause downfall of others. They may get angry, make enemies, use harsh speech but they rarely ever keep enemity for lives. They may get angry very fast but their anger also calms down after some time. But none the less Mangal does have its share of handicaps.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mangal is impatient and very harsh in speech. People under influence of Mars often make rash decisions and make enemies out of people due to their high moral values and principles. The world is not so honest and sincere. It is full of scums and leeches who thrive on looting and cheating others. Since Mangal cannot stand these things he is always at logger-heads with these people. A bride or groom who has Mangal in a prominent position cannot compromise on his\\/her ideals and principles. That is why a lot of quarrels happen and eventually divorces happen. Ofcourse astrologers do not help the cause by matching partners with Mars or <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Shani<\\/a>&nbsp;in a prominent position of the partner.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; None the less Mars does have its good side. Mars influence people easily sacrifice their own goodwill for people for whom they care. They would give up their profit for others to avoid loss. If any sort of association with Jupiter is present they could even bear loss if those they care for are profited from their sacrifice.&nbsp;Most of the prominent actors, sportsperson, celebrities and good army commanders have Mars in a very good position. Mars influence people do great in places where everything needs to be done on time like railways and armies. They make very competent lawyers and deal makers.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; In my view some people are born for the benefit of the community. They are there to make a difference. Mars influenced people are one of them. They may not be the most charming people to stay around but they are the most trustworthy, hard working and kind hearted people to be friends with.&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:45:23","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-06 07:59:59","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-06 07:57:53","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:45:23","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"7","metakey":"mangal in vedic astrology, mangal in 12 rashi, mangal in 12 bhava, mangal dosha, mangal in astrology, mars in astrology","metadesc":"mangal in vedic astrology","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Budh is young, talkative and smart. Budh is generally very close to Surya in a horoscope with maximum distance being 28 degrees from each other. Budh provides common sense, speech, communicative skills and also commands the neural processes in the brain. Budh and Guru are almost identical in that both are scholars but in present scenarios the smart and argumentative Budh wins over the knowledgable but dignified Guru. Budh takes the qualities of its co-tenants easily be it good or bad. It is a very impressionable graha. Though Budh doesn''t see most planets as enemies other then Chandra, many see him as their enemy.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this age of PR those who can market themselves get more brownie points over others. Thanks to Budh you can effectively communicate your point across to others be it via speech or via writing. Most of the scientific research and innovations are possible due to the ideas and itellact provided by Budh. Be warned that plain old Budh is nothing but sweet talk. It needs a driver to put argument into efforts and theories into practise. Grahas like Mangal, Shani and Surya''s association with Budh are the drivers behind most important inventions. Budh is a businessman or more precisely a sales man. He can sweet talk anybody into buying a product be it good or bad. Most effecient salesman, call centre operatives, shop keepers and marketers need a good Budh for success in their fields. Those who have a weak Budh may suffer from speech defects, bad communicative skills as well as mental disorders.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budh is a very impressionable graha. Like Chandra it takes the qualities of its rashi, house and co-tenants very easily. A plain old Budh rarely makes or breaks a person. With planet Surya as its co-tenant a very powerful yoga is formed known as Budh-Aditya yoga which provides knowledge, wealth and heppiness. Though not everyone gets the benefit of Budh-Aditya yoga. Association of Budh+Mangal is difficult to judge. Sometimes this association causes catostrophe because Budh is calm while Mangal is restless. Two opposing forces staying in a rashi would provide disaster. But there are times when Budh provides direction to the abundant energy of Mangal. Many great individuals have a favorable association of Budh+Mangal. Many successful lawyers have Budh+Mangal relationship in their horoscope. Budh+Guru is a favorable association by and large. Guru''s knowledge is supported by Budh''s analytical, communicative and argumentative skills. In not so favourable location you could see a thug who uses his knowledge and speech to cheat others. Either way you are guaranteed to see a smart and successful individual when Budh+Guru is there in a horoscope. Budh+Shukra is also a very good combination. Musicians and Artists are likely to have association of Mangal+Budh. Budh+Shani provides good Mathematicians and Chartered Accountants.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budh is royalty by nature and more importantly royalty without duties. So you can''t expect Budh to understand problems or do proactive work or go out of his way to help others. Budh articulate and refined speech are sure to win over a few people, but long term they are bound to see that he is nothing but trash talk. Budh''s association with Mangal, Shani or Surya in a favorable location provides great results for individual as well as the community.<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:46:04","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-06 08:02:57","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-06 08:00:32","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:46:04","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"6","metakey":"budh in vedic astrology, budh in astrology, budh in 12 bhava, budh in 12 rashi","metadesc":"budh in vedic astrology","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

The name is Venus. Popularly known as Shukra in Vedic Astrology, shukra is the planet of pleasures, luxuries and music. It is identical to <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Guru<\\/a> as it gives abundant wealth but Shukra also gives pleasures and luxuries. While it does not have the humility to handle fame or wealth, it is guaranteed that a person with prominent Shukra would have lived his\\/her life to the fullest and given pleasure to all of his\\/her sensual organs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shukra is the kamdeva personified. All the romance in the world is a gift from Shukra. The beautiful women, melodious music and mesmerizing dance moves are all thanks to the great planet called Shukra. The life force or semen which brings another life on this earth is also governed by Shukra. All the sexual organs which provide pleasures are governed by Shukra. The delicacies like Chocolate and Pastries derive their sweetness from Shukra as Shukra is the karaka for Sweetness. The people with a great disposition of Shukra are attractive, wealthy, fashionable and charming. They are admirers of art, music, fashion and beauty.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Shukra is a karaka for everything beautiful and gorgeous it does have its downsides. Shukra promotes excessive sweetness and drug addiction. It does not know any limits to pleasures and romance. Most of the taboo activities are carried on when a person is either under the influence of Shukra or with association to Mangal and <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Rahu<\\/a>.

All the marriages done on whims and instant attraction are due to Shukra-Mangal connections. When there is Rahu involved with Shukra marriage may even be with the wrong person and leads to bad reputation for the individual and their close relatives. Shukra causes drug, alcohol and sex addiction. Even addiction to medicines and prescribed drugs is possible with bad placement of Shukra.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that it does do wonderful with <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Chandra<\\/a> as co-tenant. The individual with Shukra+Chandra as co-tenant could have a romantic equation of epic proportions on par with Romeo-Juliet or Heer-Ranjhaana and remain inseparable throughout life. Shukra with Guru as co-tenant may give wealth, happiness and knowledge but many a times it is through illegal means. Shukra with Shani is quite bad as Shani''s negativity is a damp squid for sensual and pleasurable Shukra. But since both planets are friendly it rarely causes destruction. An aspect of Shani or Guru on Shukra is quite a blessing to have. Shukra also gives love for animals and provides benefits through them in a favourable placement.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most beautiful woman and fortunate man have Shukra in a very good disposition. All the famous celebrities have a good Shukra or a favourable period of good Shukra. While Guru may give wealth, happiness and knowledge to a native leave it to Shukra to give you the finer things in life. Shukra natives are like a horse wihout a lease which can run off anywhere he\\/she pleases. The kind of ecstacy, pleasures and forbidden desires which Shukra provides can only be dreamt by other planets. Fame and fortune is abundant for people with a good Shukra.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ofcourse with no boundary between acceptance and taboo most of the Shukra influenced people go bonkers after a certain time start resorting to drugs or even medicines to calm their mind. Romance and Sensual pleasures could be over the top but so is the risk of catching a venereal disease. Love takes a backseat and lust would control your mind and body unless there is a limiting aspect of Guru or Shani involved. The price of being a celebrityy is high with no privacy or peace but those who only crave for Page 3 lifestyle should start pleasing dear sweet aunty known as Shukra. For people with problematic Shukra praying to Lord Krishna or Goddess Laxmi for improving the condition and Goddess Santoshi Maa for decreasing the side-effects of afflicted Shukra is highly beneficial.<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:46:57","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-06 08:07:23","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-06 08:05:37","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:46:57","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"4","metakey":"shukra in vedic astrology, shukra in astrology, shukra in 12 bhavas, shukra in 12 rashi, shukra in astrology","metadesc":"shukra in vedic astrology","access":"1","hits":"4","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Shani represents scarcity, fear, oppression, old age and poverty. Well that alone seems to put this humble planet in the category of worst of the worst. By all means Shani can be said to be a malefic planet who brings adversities and havoc in our lives but the perspective has to change regarding how we look at adversities to understand the working of Shani a little more.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start by saying that Shani is appointed as a judge by&nbsp;<a href=\\"http:\\/\\/www.sanatansociety.org\\/hindu_gods_and_goddesses\\/shiva.htm\\">Lord Shiva<\\/a> himself. A normal judiciary functions according to laws of the country and Shani functions according to divine laws of the nature. Shani is aware of most of our karmas and he provides punishments befitting our crimes. Most of the human beings are far from noble souls. We lie, steal, ridicule others and even deceive or backstab others. This is not limited to one birth time but continues over several births and rebirths. Though we may not be aware of these crimes, gramps Shani keeps a watchful eye over these karmas. Remember, he cannot punish you unless you have done some crime. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why the fear of gramps Shani? Well, we are human beings after all. We cannot fathom why we need patience, hard work and discipline while the other guy gets the ferraris, the beautiful mansions and the iPhones. The sooner we learn the need for discipline, hard work, patience, fortitude and empathy the sooner does gramps Shani move out of our way. He does give wonderful results to those who plan the long road to success with honest and sincere efforts and plan betterment of the community and world. But those good fruits take a long, long time to come. By that time your patience is tested to the limits and your ego and arrogance is washed away. You are new and renewed all dignified, kind and considerate to your fellow beings. &nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is gramps Shani good or bad? Well he is bad cause we often plan shortcuts in life and easy way out of misery and suffering. That is the sole reason why Shani makes our lives a miserable hell. Say you are a prisoner in a jail and the warden catches you &nbsp;trying to sneak out of jail before your sentence is over. Most of us would assume that the warden would be very upset and may sentence us to more severe punishment. Same thing applies to Shani but he actually cares for his prisoners and wants them to be contributing members of the society. We do not like Shani cause he is a strict teacher who likes to whip now and then to teach some discipline and hard work to his students. No one likes to learn the things the hard way so to speak.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said all this Shani has positive aspects in life also. Most of the guys who grow from rags to riches have Shani in an important disposition in their horoscope. Most of the people who make a difference in lives of others have Shani in exalted or own sign or in a good position. Shani destroys everything that is not sustainable over a long period of time. That includes relationships. Most of the divorces happen during the Saade-Saati or Shani Periods. Though it may seem like hell at that time after some time we come to realise that the relationship couldn''t have worked out and what happened was for the better. Our ego is destroyed and we learn the importance of patience and dignity. At the end of saade-saati most people develop a positive outlook towards lives.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day it all comes down to perspective. A simple, easy-going life is a choice of most but attainable by few. Those who believe in making lemonade, when lemons are provided fare much better in life then those who cry while looking at the lemons. Success is not defined by how high a person rises but how many times a person gets up after falling.&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:47:34","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-06 08:10:11","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-06 08:08:00","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:47:34","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":4,"ordering":"3","metakey":"shani in vedic astrology, shani in astrology, shani in 12 bhava, shani in 12 rashi, saade-saati, shani and superstition","metadesc":"shani in vedic astrology","access":"1","hits":"9","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Rahu is &nbsp;smokey and mysterious. He represents black arts, magic, taboo activities and foreigners. Rahu is an impersonator who tries to show the qualities he does not have.

Rahu carries the mandate of putting a human being under illusion. Rahu encourages individuals to take risky and foolish decisions which only bring harm and loss for him. Ofcourse, sometimes it gives quite favorable results for people interested in forbidden desires and&nbsp;taboo activites. Not only that money, power, sex and fame are also abundant in a favorable period of Rahu.&nbsp;Most politicians have a very good Rahu. Rahu is a karaka for foreigners and everything mysterious.

The simple and wise Guru meets Rahu who is full of deceit and camaflouge. Naturally they don''t get along well. Rahu+Shukra is not as bad and actually gives quite good results. People with Shukra+Rahu are often driven by taboo activites and forbidden desires. The bad results of Rahu+Shukra are blind love followed by divorce.

It is a malefic planet but that does mean it is literally bad. The facts about Ketu are often misinterpreted to suit the worldy desires so much so that it has lost its divine purpose. Ketu is capable of taking an individual closer to moksha. Only <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Guru<\\/a> is the other planet which can boasts of this great feat. The final purpose of all living beings is to get closer to the Supreme Entity aka God.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why the unnecessary prejudice towards Ketu? Well the fact that Ketu has its own agenda which is free from the social norms, rules and regulations makes it quite a villian for the society. The world is not known to welcome people who go against social norms. Most of people with Ketu in lagna or with <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Chandra<\\/a> in horoscope are detached from others and live a solitary life. They have a nihilistic, uncaring and unapologetic attitude towards society as a whole. They are meant to break away from the social bonds which bind the individuals to society. Some of them even resort to total reclusiveness from society in the form of Sanyas. Others less fortunate try to live a detached life while remaining in the society constantly at logger-heads with the cultural norms.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets talk of the downside of Ketu in a bad placement for a bit. Ketu is the astrological equivalent word of detachment. Divorces, Separation from loved ones and Solitary Life would send quivers down anyone''s spine. As long as you live in this world ones self is bound to have inclinations towards socialisation, recognition, acceptence, affection and attraction. It is only natural to have these feelings. The greatest of the saints and holy souls desired for such comforts and pleasures. Now the person who lived in solitary confinement and emotional reclusiveness cannot just mix with the society like sugar in water. They would always stick out like a sore thumb. Eventually their desires fade away and they become even more reclusive and paranoid of the society. They loose purpose and motivation in their life. But fear not as Krishna said in the Gita:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\"text-align: left;\\">\\"<em>One who walks on path towards knowledge and engages in auspicious activities does not meet his end.<\\/em>\\" --Bhagvad Gita Chapter 6 Verse 40<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence here is person with a good Ketu is naturally detached and not interested in materialistic goals and social confirmity. That alone brings them closer to the Supreme Entity which is the final goal of all human beings. For them their own inner voice is final take on everything. As long as you don''t care about society it would be the highest blessing to have Ketu in lagna or with Chandra or have period of Ketu which brings separation from loved ones. For others who are bonded with society there is a solution to pray to Lord Ganesh to lessen the effects of a malefic Ketu.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\\"color: #000000;\\">&nbsp;<\\/span><\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:48:24","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-06 08:26:01","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-06 08:14:44","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:48:24","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"1","metakey":"ketu in vedic astrology, ketu in astrology, ketu in 12 bhavas, ketu in 12 rashi","metadesc":"ketu in vedic astrology","access":"1","hits":"8","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

It is used to know about physical appearance, skin color, body constitution, personality and intelligence of the person. In simpler terms the First House in a horoscope is the mirror to the individual whose horoscope is shown. The important thing to know is only a summary is possible through First House. The whole thesis of an individual requires lots of careful study of various factors including Chandra Lagna, Surya Lagna, Nakshatra Lords of Lagna and Chandra and last by not least the Lagnesha.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1st house ispart of Vishnu Sthanas as well as trine called Laxmi Sthanas. The physical attributes and complexion of individuals are based on rashi in lagna, lagnesha and also the nakshatra lords of lagna and lagnesha. The emotional characteristics of individual can be more accurately predicted using lagna, lagnesha and Chandra''s placement in horoscope and nakshatra lord of <a href=\\"option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Chandra<\\/a>.

Same way Surya Lagna is used to decipher the spiritual view of things.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each lagna\\/first house has a planetary lord which is known as lagnesha. The placement of lagnesha is also very important to be considered when talking about charecteristics, health, emotions and physical attributes. A troubled placement of lagnesha suggests a troubled individual while a favourable placement of lagnesha suggests success and happiness for individual. Whatever the result one could find his true self through First House and Lagnesha. The rashi charecteristics are also absorbed by First House. Say a Cancer in Lagna\\/First House at time of birth suggest a kind and caring person. His complexion is generally fairer compared to those around him.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ever find the need to discover youself using astrology then first house is a nice place to start. It provides a brief overview of you as a person. If you carefully study First House including Chandra Lagna, Surya Lagna, Nakshatra Lord of Lagna and Lagnesha as well as Rashi in First House you could solve the big jigsaw puzzle that is your characture and nature.

A good astrologer can provide better advice for where you stand with matters of 2nd house. &nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"11","created":"2014-02-01 11:52:14","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-06 08:29:51","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-06 08:28:50","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:52:14","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"10","metakey":"2nd house, dhan bhava, vedic astrology","metadesc":"2nd house in vedic astrology","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Not only that a facebook profile, a tweet, a youtube video &amp; an instagram photo would probably fetch you a good income if it is worth it. Though the money may not necessarily come directly through them there are enough people who want a superstar in the required field to sell their brands. 3rd house also looks after negotiation and communication skills. A &nbsp;star campaigner who sells the products and procures a deal are a blessing for big companies. Most importantly 3rd house is the house of courage.

For people who are into emotional and spiritual progress it is better to look elsewhere in a horoscope.<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"11","created":"2014-02-01 11:58:09","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-06 09:06:32","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-06 09:05:13","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:58:09","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"7","metakey":"5th house, vedic astrology, putra bhava","metadesc":"5th house in vedic astrology","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

The more hostile planets in hostile rashi the more chances of a person having enemies. Some maybe disguised as your friends and well-wishers. 6th house is the best bet to finding your enemies and ways to counter them. Over and above that addictions of any type can be deciphered using planets located in the 6th house. 6th house is also the house of servants. In simpler terms whether you are born to be satisfied with your office role or whether there are chances to open your business can be know through combination of 6th house and 10th house.

That notion goes away once there is a transit of Shani or Ketu or aspect of Shani. Dreams are quite good while they lasts but when you wake up there is a harsh reality of being stuck in an unwanted relation for your whole life.

Of course 8th house just carries the mandate of karma which would lead the individual to a higher path. At the end of the day it is all a matter of perspective. Some consider transformation as painful while others consider it a blessing in disguise. According to a famous proverb- \\"One person''s funeral is another person''s bread\\".

Dharma doesn''t necessarily equate to religion or religious activities. From a astrological point of view Dharma actually means duties and obligation that a person has to fulfill. As Shakespeare rightly put it- \\"The World is a stage and we are all actors\\". Everyone has to perform a specific task in the big machinery. 9th house is the place where one becomes aware of meaning of life but more importantly he becomes aware of his Dharma or Duty as a Person. Depending on planets and aspects a person may become religious, seek higher education, wander off to foreign lands and even try asceticism and divination. All of this are just to find the higher purpose in life. When a person finds meaning to his existence he is ready to try and attain his purpose in life through 10th house.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From materialistic point of view 9th house is the house of fortune. When you want maximum returns from minimum efforts and investment one has to pray for a good 9th house. A powerful 9th house can guarantee a successful, charming and influential individual in the social sphere. Individuals who plan to settle abroad and live a happy life should have a favorable 9th house. Aspirants of higher studies also need to look at the 9th house and favorable aspects on it before applying for higher education. Any sort of association through planets or aspects with Vishnu Sthanas or Laxmi Sthanas is ideal for 9th house. Also association with <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11:dhana-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110\\">2nd house<\\/a> and <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20:labh-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110\\">11th house<\\/a> is good.

It is the house which gives grief, despair and losses to an individual. Losses are not just monetary but also emotional and physical. As one of the hell houses it can literally put individuals through the motions and create depression and anxities of unparallel quantities. 12th house also rules over prisons, ashrams, hospitals and mental institutions.

Who would want to voluntarily go to prisons, hospitals or mental institutions? Who would like depression grief, despair and losses?

But after careful observation and practical experience a hypothesis starts to develop that the 12th house is perhaps the most misunderstood house in astrology.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While not many people reading this article would care to get Moksha, it is essential to know that no rebirth equates to no suffering. For those who do not believe in the concept of Moksha, there is higher knowledge and deeper meaning of life associated with the 12th house. An individual gains an understanding of concepts which are outside the scope of what is already known. This is the reason why research and doctarate programmes are under the wings of the 12th house as these are fields where knowledge is not yet present in this world. For those who don''t care two hoots about Moksha or Knowldge there is the most important aspect called bed pleasures ruled by 12th house. Many marriages break on complaints of incomplete or no sexual satisfaction derived from partners. 12th house ascertains whether you have a good life in bed or not.

It is a karaka for mind and everything related to it. Moon also affects the blood circulation as well as water portions on the body and on earth. Well that implies nearly 70% of body and of earth are affected by Chandra. Chandra maybe a small planet and it only stays in a rashi for 2.5 days but its implications are huge when you take the co-tenants, rashi and house lords into consideration. Chandra brings tides and ebbs in an ocean and similarly it brings tides and ebbs in a human mind also. Every positive or negative, good or evil, happy or sad, nice or bad thought that comes to an individual is thanks to chandra and associations and afflictions to chandra.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moon is the closest planet to the earth. Theoretically it is a satellite. Just like satellites are responsible for good and bad signals in a television; Chandra is responsible for good and bad thoughts in an individual. <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Shani<\\/a> and <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Rahu<\\/a> association with Chandra is a prime factor for people with weak or malefic thought process. Of course the rashi occupied by Chandra also plays an important role in shaping the thought process of an individual. Generally speaking association of Chandra to Shani, Rahu, <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Mangal<\\/a>, <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4:buddh&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Budh<\\/a>, <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:surya&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Surya<\\/a> and <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9:ketu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Ketu<\\/a> is considered bad. Though bear in mind it is not always the case.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is highly impressionable graha. It quickly takes in the qualities of its rashi, co-tenants and grahas which aspect it.&nbsp;Lets talk in more detail about Chandra and associations with other planets.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Surya is called as Amavasya or No Moon. Many astrologers and jyotishis push the panic button once they hear of this scenario. Various havans, poojas and rings are provided to calm these so called horrible scenario. Well the truth couldn''t be farther off. Well Surya is soul and Chandra is the mind and it wouldn''t be so bad if soul and mind become one considering that soul is considered part of god and mind is the most definiting part in an invidual.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Mangal is considered auspicious by many astrologers cause it gives abundant wealth. That is partly true but they forget to mention that this association gives rise to a wounded warrior who is always there to take revenge on others.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Budh is probably among the worst. Most mental disorders are caused by this association. Chandra controls the mind while Budh takes care of nervous system. Not to mention this association causes an individual to be a chatter box.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association to Guru is probably the best. In a favourable rashi it causes a powerful yoga called Gaja Kesari yoga. It gives abundant wealth, happiness and prosperity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Shukra is also good. It provides abundant love. Most of the romeo-juliet stories are thanks to Chandra-Shukra association. The fairest and most beautiful looking individuals both male and female are very likely to have assocation of Chandra with Shukra.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Shani causes Vish Yoga. The mind is constantly in thinking process and nothing comes out of tireless thinking but sadness and worries. Depression is one of the possible scenarious with Shani-Chandra association. But people who learn to control their emotions and adapt to difficulties and changing scenarios become great individuals but that doesn''t come without a struggle.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra with Rahu is bad in general terms. Rahu is cloudy and smokey and causes disruption to natural though process. Simply speaking this association clouds judgement of an individual.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Ketu is bad for some and good for some. Ketu is the planet of detachment. Well for those who want to get closer to the god; this placement provides the right tools of obtaining that goal. For those who are too caught up with materialistic success; consider this placement to quite a bother and probably arrange for some counter measures.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is very small but its implications on human beings are pretty big. It alone is a gentle, calm and caring graha but depending on rashi lordship or co-tenants it could bring peace or havoc in your life. The greatest enemy or friend of an individual is not anyone but his mind and thoughts. Once you control your own mind; controlling this world is not that difficult.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"10","created":"2014-02-01 11:44:20","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-19 07:48:24","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-19 07:47:39","publish_up":"2014-02-01 11:44:20","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":5,"ordering":"8","metakey":"chandra in vedic astrology, chandra in astrology, chandra in 12 bhava, chandra in 12 rashi","metadesc":"chandra in vedic astrology","access":"1","hits":"17","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Quite an irony considering these two subjects are driven by Destiny. It is human tendency to ask for happiness and satisfaction in life and that is not possible without a stable and successful career. The web based definition of Career is \\"An occupation for a significant period of person''s life with opportunities for progress\\". Focus is on Significant Period and Opportunities. Unless it is for a long duration there is no stability and without stability there is no happiness or peace. Without Opportunities there is no growth and without growth there are no profits or savings.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10th house and 6th house are analyzed by astrologers for Career. But what they should actually check is the 11th House which the House of Gains and Regular Income. After all everyone is in the business of making money so why bother with 10th house and 6th house. Any connection of the 11th house with any other planetary lords of any house would ensure profits or income in the given field. In a way it is not a bad idea to ignore 6th house and 10th house. But life''s purpose is governed by the 10th house and life''s debt are measured by 6th house. Since income is governed by destiny it is imperative to check the 6th house for person''s debt or service he must undertake and 10th house to know the Karma which was planned for him. For example if you are meant to be a doctor and to serve poor and needy then Karma would drive you in a place where people are poor and needy. If you are meant to be surgeon and earn millions through operating then Karma would drive you in that direction. End of the day it all depends on life''s purpose. No point running away from it whatever income you get.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you are planning Career in Business or as Top Executive in an organization a strong 10th House is prerequisite. Career in Service Roles, as Doctors or Social work is governed by the 6th House. 7th House governs Contracts, Business Partnership and Negotiations. 3rd House governs Communication, Public Relationship, Meetings and Media. 5th house governs Politics, Entertainment, &nbsp;and Theater. 8th House governs Taxes and Money Bonds. 2nd House governs Speech and Gold. 4th House governs Agriculture, Cattle Rearing and Transport. 11th House governs Quick Gains and Share Markets. 12th House governs Monasteries (Ashrams), Universities, Jails, Bedroom Pleasures. Depending on the strength of the house and the planetary lord of the house the precise career can be deciphered.&nbsp;Planetary combinations also can be used to decipher the career of an individual. Mangal+Budh makes for an excellent Engineer especially Hardware or Software Engineer. Shani+Budh can make for a good Chartered Accountant. Chandra+Shukra is the best for Entertainment business, Jewelry Design or Cosmetics. Guru+Chandra is ideal for setting up your own Business, Share Markets or Teaching. Surya can make an excellent Administrator or Farmer.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All said and done stability in career depends on lot of other factors. It is rarely noticed that a person stays in the same career for his whole life. A Shani Saade-Saati or a bad Vimshottri Dasha is enough to put you out of job or business. Sometimes destiny could instigate a person to pursue change in occupation. Sometimes they may work in your favor while other times they may prove a catastrophe. Ultimately it is destiny of an individual which would drive him.

Ofcourse real love has no regrets or resentment and only wants the well being of the concerned love interest. But that love is unlikely barring a few yogas are in a horoscope.

There are a couple of odd superstitions related with Shani. It is a human tendency to feel anger, anguish and fear of things which we do not comprehend. But it is necessary to understand the cause of fear and worries to get a solution in life. Here are a couple of superstitions commonly associated with Shani which are dispelled through adequate reasoning. Furthermore the activities done or suggested to pacify Shani are also properly analyzed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4><strong>Superstition 1: Shani Saade Saati is always bad<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>This is the most unwarranted fear I''ve come across. As soon as a Saade-Saati starts people start to think that the next seven and half years of life would be hell. Some smart ones refer to an astrologer and decipher the effects of all 3 phases of two and half period to know which is the worst and which is favorable for them. Even the Jyotish instills unnecessary fear in the native and gives them wrong message.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani Saade Saati is an excellent time to burn past life karma be it good or bad. It only gives back what you''ve given in the past life and this life before the Saade Saati began. Depending on your karma all 3 subperiods could be good like heaven or bad like hell. So just think of doing good karma and eventually nothing bad would happen. Ofcourse progress is stalled but that doesn''t mean you don''t get the fruits of your hard work ever.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 2: Harsh Times go away by offering Oil to Shani and Lord Hanuman Idols<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>This is another crazy theory propogated by astrologers and priest alike. Obviously they would make a fortune out of it so they would love to see more and more people coming to offer oil. Imagine a temple where everyone offers 100 ml of oil to the idols. Say 300 people come to the temple out of which 200 pour oil on the idol. That equates to 20 litre of oil being wasted on a Saturday alone. That are rough statistics for one temple. Say in India and abroad there are atleast 1000 temples of Lord Hanuman &amp; Shani. So Saturday amounts for 20,000 litres of oil wastage due to a stupid superstition. That oil could have been used to feed the poor, export to other countries or even cook for oneself (after all God resides in each and every soul)<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani is the karaka for Scarcity, Famine and Drought. Imagine you go to Sahara Desert and waste water in front of the native who resides there. You can imagine how angry he would be cause he has to struggle to get drinking water. Same way I can only imagine how mad Mr. Grandpa Shani would be by wastage of oil on idols. It is better to donate oil to a poor cause Shani is also a karaka for Poverty.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4><strong>Superstition 3: Shani Chalisa and Shani Prayers are needed to calm the effects of furious Shani<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>I''ve seen people do religious mantra, superstitious activities and speak prayers of God and Gramps Shani all day long. While I am not against prayers of God, prayers to planet are not right in my opinion. They are just planets who follow a fix trajectory. They won''t change their trajectory for anyone. So why bother appeasing them?<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani couldn''t care less about appeasement cause he is a judge of people''s karma and he has to stay impartial and deliver due justice to the native. It doesn''t matter to him if you are a King or Servant, Rich or Poor, Religious or Non-Believer. I would suggest prayers to your favorite Gods once and to keep calm and continue to do your duties. That would be like a mercy plea in front of Judge Shani and he would oblidge and give mercy for sure.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 4: Shani drishti is always bad<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>These might not be totally false cause even the literatures on Shani propogate this theory. But what they also describe is Shani is the judge of one''s karma.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani gives results of past lives karma and that maybe an accumulation of many lives. Unless a native has done horrendous acts in his\\/her past lives it is not possible that horoscope houses which are aspected by Shani at birthtime keep on giving continuous bad results. What is necessary to know is Shani gives good or bad results to each house its transits or aspects when it moves in a Gochara Transit.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In the end all I want to say is don''t fret about Shani like he is some relentless stalker or merciless killer. Just keep calm through periods of Shani and try to do your karma as effectively as you can. Understand that failures and disappointments are part and parcel of life and they help us stay grounded.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Feel free to drop in a comment if you have any questions on the concerned article.<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"20","created":"2014-02-04 08:12:14","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-24 06:33:01","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-24 06:31:41","publish_up":"2014-03-24 06:33:01","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Natives with a strong Mangal get angry quickly, are harsh in speech and fast excited and bored in relationship but it can also be said they are strong in calamities, trustworthy in relationship and honest with partners.

Mangal placement or drishti on the following houses causes problems according to astrologers. But it isn''t so wrong to say in today''s world as long as two people get along and have good physical relationship everything else is trivial. In the long term even the physical relationship is redundant and only the repo between two individuals is primary.

This practise may or may not give desired results. It is advised to only proceed if you have faith in this ceremony otherwise not to do if you feel it is superstitious and waste of time.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>3. Fasting from first tuesday of a month based on lunar calendar. This helps greatly especially if no salt is consumed on tuesday and less salt is consumed on other days.

There are a couple of odd superstitions related with Shani. It is a human tendency to feel anger, anguish and fear of things which we do not comprehend. But it is necessary to understand the cause of fear and worries to get a solution in life. Here are a couple of superstitions commonly associated with Shani which are dispelled through adequate reasoning. Furthermore the activities done or suggested to pacify Shani are also properly analyzed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4><strong>Superstition 1: Shani Saade Saati is always bad<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>This is the most unwarranted fear I''ve come across. As soon as a Saade-Saati starts people start to think that the next seven and half years of life would be hell. Some smart ones refer to an astrologer and decipher the effects of all 3 phases of two and half period to know which is the worst and which is favorable for them. Even the Jyotish instills unnecessary fear in the native and gives them wrong message.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani Saade Saati is an excellent time to burn past life karma be it good or bad. It only gives back what you''ve given in the past life and this life before the Saade Saati began. Depending on your karma all 3 subperiods could be good like heaven or bad like hell. So just think of doing good karma and eventually nothing bad would happen. Ofcourse progress is stalled but that doesn''t mean you don''t get the fruits of your hard work ever.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 2: Harsh Times go away by offering Oil to Shani and Lord Hanuman Idols<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>This is another crazy theory propogated by astrologers and priest alike. Obviously they would make a fortune out of it so they would love to see more and more people coming to offer oil. Imagine a temple where everyone offers 100 ml of oil to the idols. Say 300 people come to the temple out of which 200 pour oil on the idol. That equates to 20 litre of oil being wasted on a Saturday alone. That are rough statistics for one temple. Say in India and abroad there are atleast 1000 temples of Lord Hanuman &amp; Shani. So Saturday amounts for 20,000 litres of oil wastage due to a stupid superstition. That oil could have been used to feed the poor, export to other countries or even cook for oneself (after all God resides in each and every soul)<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani is the karaka for Scarcity, Famine and Drought. Imagine you go to Sahara Desert and waste water in front of the native who resides there. You can imagine how angry he would be cause he has to struggle to get drinking water. Same way I can only imagine how mad Mr. Grandpa Shani would be by wastage of oil on idols. It is better to donate oil to a poor cause Shani is also a karaka for Poverty.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4><strong>Superstition 3: Shani Chalisa and Shani Prayers are needed to calm the effects of furious Shani<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>I''ve seen people do religious mantra, superstitious activities and speak prayers of God and Gramps Shani all day long. While I am not against prayers of God, prayers to planet are not right in my opinion. They are just planets who follow a fix trajectory. They won''t change their trajectory for anyone. So why bother appeasing them?<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani couldn''t care less about appeasement cause he is a judge of people''s karma and he has to stay impartial and deliver due justice to the native. It doesn''t matter to him if you are a King or Servant, Rich or Poor, Religious or Non-Believer. I would suggest prayers to your favorite Gods once and to keep calm and continue to do your duties. That would be like a mercy plea in front of Judge Shani and he would oblidge and give mercy for sure.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 4: Shani drishti is always bad<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>These might not be totally false cause even the literatures on Shani propogate this theory. But what they also describe is Shani is the judge of one''s karma.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani gives results of past lives karma and that maybe an accumulation of many lives. Unless a native has done horrendous acts in his\\/her past lives it is not possible that horoscope houses which are aspected by Shani at birthtime keep on giving continuous bad results. What is necessary to know is Shani gives good or bad results to each house its transits or aspects when it moves in a Gochara Transit.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In the end all I want to say is don''t fret about Shani like he is some relentless stalker or merciless killer. Just keep calm through periods of Shani and try to do your karma as effectively as you can. Understand that failures and disappointments are part and parcel of life and they help us stay grounded.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Feel free to drop in a comment if you have any questions on the concerned article.<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"20","created":"2014-02-04 08:12:14","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-24 06:42:10","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-24 06:42:04","publish_up":"2014-03-24 06:33:01","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":4,"ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

So why bother appeasing them?<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani couldn''t care less about appeasement cause he is a judge of people''s karma and he has to stay impartial and deliver due justice to the native. It doesn''t matter to him if you are a King or Servant, Rich or Poor, Religious or Non-Believer. I would suggest prayers to your favorite Gods once and to keep calm and continue to do your duties. That would be like a mercy plea in front of Judge Shani and he would oblidge and give mercy for sure.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 4: Shani drishti is always bad<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>These might not be totally false cause even the literatures on Shani propogate this theory. But what they also describe is Shani is the judge of one''s karma.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani gives results of past lives karma and that maybe an accumulation of many lives. Unless a native has done horrendous acts in his\\/her past lives it is not possible that horoscope houses which are aspected by Shani at birthtime keep on giving continuous bad results. What is necessary to know is Shani gives good or bad results to each house its transits or aspects when it moves in a Gochara Transit.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In the end all I want to say is don''t fret about Shani like he is some relentless stalker or merciless killer. Just keep calm through periods of Shani and try to do your karma as effectively as you can. Understand that failures and disappointments are part and parcel of life and they help us stay grounded.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Feel free to drop in a comment if you have any questions on the concerned article.<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"20","created":"2014-02-04 08:12:14","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-24 06:50:23","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-24 06:50:18","publish_up":"2014-03-24 06:33:01","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":5,"ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Some astrologers count both Chandra and Lagna house as ascendent. Chances that you have a Mangal Dosha shoot up from 50% to about 75% if both Chandra and Lagna are counted as ascendent.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n","fulltext":"\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal Dosha is nothing to worry about. It is likely to be present in 50% of the population atleast. What is necessary to understand is the nature of Mangal. Mangal is fiery and strong, quick and trustworthy, harsh in speech but honest. Natives with a strong Mangal get angry quickly, are harsh in speech and fast excited and bored in relationship but it can also be said they are strong in calamities, trustworthy in relationship and honest with partners. So why the fear?<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marriage is a contract which cannot be declared void as it has clauses. It is an agreement which cannot be broken without consequences. So it is only natural for astrologers and believers to fear Mangal Dosha. After all you couldn''t live with a person who is angered, craves excessive sexual pleasures and is harsh in speech for your whole life. Slowly but surely the detachment (Ketu) and despair (Shani) start to cloud a partner''s mind and partner eventually opts for divorce. Is it worth the risk going into marriage if such a scenario occurs? While these are far fetched theories and assumptions it is also necessary to accept that a human mind is prone to think positive or negative thoughts based on character and situations. Lets look at the most likely relationships which are likely to suffer adverse effects due to Mangal Dosha.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal in a horoscope (counted from lagna) casts a drishti on 4th, 7th and 8th house from its placement. In a marriage the native (suggested through 1st house), partner (suggested through 7th house), the immediate family of native (suggested through 2nd house) and immediate family of partner (suggested through 8th house), physical relationship (suggested through 12th house), vitality and life of native (suggested through 8th house) and life &amp; vitality of partner (suggested through 2nd house) play a very important role in long time survial of the marriage and Mangal in any of these locations is enough to bring Mangal Dosha into equation for astrologers. Mangal placement or drishti on the following houses causes problems according to astrologers. But it isn''t so wrong to say in today''s world as long as two people get along and have good physical relationship everything else is trivial. In the long term even the physical relationship is redundant and only the repo between two individuals is primary. But since humans like to socialize every equation for relationship is taken into consideration by astrologers.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>There are various remedies on Mangal Dosha provided as mentioned below:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>1. Marrying another person with Mangal Dosha which may not always be useful<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>2. Doing a Kumbh Vivah ceremony which requires native to marry a tree or idol of Vishnu before actual marriage. This practise may or may not give desired results. It is advised to only proceed if you have faith in this ceremony otherwise not to do if you feel it is superstitious and waste of time.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>3. Fasting from first tuesday of a month based on lunar calendar. This helps greatly especially if no salt is consumed on tuesday and less salt is consumed on other days. Reduction in sodium and potassium level not only reduces blood pressure but it also reduces excessive energy and fiery emotions in natives with a Mangal Dosha<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>4. Donating blood once every three month. While this solution has no scientific or religious validity associated it is not a bad idea just for the sake of blood donation drive to prosper. It doesn''t harm an individual if blood is donated and it also helps the society.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>5. Worship Hanuman, reciting Sunder Kand and visiting Hanuman temples. This helps greatly cause Lord Hanuman is lord of wisdom. He has strength and courage but is humble and submissive at the same time. This trait is subconsiously cultiaved in native by prayers to Lord Hanuman.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal Dosha is not as troublesome issue for marriage as it is made out to be. All it requires is to be aware of it if indeed present in horoscope and if this dosha is not cancelled by other factors. Even if you don''t give a damn about Mangal Dosha it is worth to note that anger, too much sex and harsh speech can destroy any relationship and careful consideration needs to be given not to cross your limit in a relationship.&nbsp;<\\/p>","state":1,"catid":"20","created":"2014-03-24 07:33:41","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-24 07:38:28","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-24 07:37:59","publish_up":"2014-03-24 06:34:05","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":7,"ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

There are a couple of odd superstitions related with Shani. It is a human tendency to feel anger, anguish and fear of things which we do not comprehend. But it is necessary to understand the cause of fear and worries to get a solution in life. Here are a couple of superstitions commonly associated with Shani which are dispelled through adequate reasoning. Furthermore the activities done or suggested to pacify Shani are also properly analyzed.<\\/p>\\r\\n","fulltext":"\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4><strong>Superstition 1: Shani Saade Saati is always bad<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>This is the most unwarranted fear I''ve come across. As soon as a Saade-Saati starts people start to think that the next seven and half years of life would be hell. Some smart ones refer to an astrologer and decipher the effects of all 3 phases of two and half period to know which is the worst and which is favorable for them. Even the Jyotish instills unnecessary fear in the native and gives them wrong message.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani Saade Saati is an excellent time to burn past life karma be it good or bad. It only gives back what you''ve given in the past life and this life before the Saade Saati began. Depending on your karma all 3 subperiods could be good like heaven or bad like hell. So just think of doing good karma and eventually nothing bad would happen. Ofcourse progress is stalled but that doesn''t mean you don''t get the fruits of your hard work ever.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 2: Harsh Times go away by offering Oil to Shani and Lord Hanuman Idols<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>This is another crazy theory propogated by astrologers and priest alike. Obviously they would make a fortune out of it so they would love to see more and more people coming to offer oil. Imagine a temple where everyone offers 100 ml of oil to the idols. Say 300 people come to the temple out of which 200 pour oil on the idol. That equates to 20 litre of oil being wasted on a Saturday alone. That are rough statistics for one temple. Say in India and abroad there are atleast 1000 temples of Lord Hanuman &amp; Shani. So Saturday amounts for 20,000 litres of oil wastage due to a stupid superstition. That oil could have been used to feed the poor, export to other countries or even cook for oneself (after all God resides in each and every soul)<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani is the karaka for Scarcity, Famine and Drought. Imagine you go to Sahara Desert and waste water in front of the native who resides there. You can imagine how angry he would be cause he has to struggle to get drinking water. Same way I can only imagine how mad Mr. Grandpa Shani would be by wastage of oil on idols. It is better to donate oil to a poor cause Shani is also a karaka for Poverty.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4><strong>Superstition 3: Shani Chalisa and Shani Prayers are needed to calm the effects of furious Shani<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>I''ve seen people do religious mantra, superstitious activities and speak prayers of God and Gramps Shani all day long. While I am not against prayers of God, prayers to planet are not right in my opinion. They are just planets who follow a fix trajectory. They won''t change their trajectory for anyone.

Some astrologers count both Chandra and Lagna house as ascendent. Chances that you have a Mangal Dosha shoot up from 50% to about 75% if both Chandra and Lagna are counted as ascendent.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\\"font-size: 11px;\\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal Dosha is nothing to worry about. It is likely to be present in 50% of the population atleast. What is necessary to understand is the nature of Mangal. Mangal is fiery and strong, quick and trustworthy, harsh in speech but honest. Natives with a strong Mangal get angry quickly, are harsh in speech and fast excited and bored in relationship but it can also be said they are strong in calamities, trustworthy in relationship and honest with partners. So why the fear?<\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marriage is a contract which cannot be declared void as it has clauses. It is an agreement which cannot be broken without consequences. So it is only natural for astrologers and believers to fear Mangal Dosha. After all you couldn''t live with a person who is angered, craves excessive sexual pleasures and is harsh in speech for your whole life. Slowly but surely the detachment (Ketu) and despair (Shani) start to cloud a partner''s mind and partner eventually opts for divorce. Is it worth the risk going into marriage if such a scenario occurs? While these are far fetched theories and assumptions it is also necessary to accept that a human mind is prone to think positive or negative thoughts based on character and situations. Lets look at the most likely relationships which are likely to suffer adverse effects due to Mangal Dosha.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal in a horoscope (counted from lagna) casts a drishti on 4th, 7th and 8th house from its placement. In a marriage the native (suggested through 1st house), partner (suggested through 7th house), the immediate family of native (suggested through 2nd house) and immediate family of partner (suggested through 8th house), physical relationship (suggested through 12th house), vitality and life of native (suggested through 8th house) and life &amp; vitality of partner (suggested through 2nd house) play a very important role in long time survial of the marriage and Mangal in any of these locations is enough to bring Mangal Dosha into equation for astrologers. Mangal placement or drishti on the following houses causes problems according to astrologers. But it isn''t so wrong to say in today''s world as long as two people get along and have good physical relationship everything else is trivial. In the long term even the physical relationship is redundant and only the repo between two individuals is primary. But since humans like to socialize every equation for relationship is taken into consideration by astrologers.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>There are various remedies on Mangal Dosha provided as mentioned below:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>1. Marrying another person with Mangal Dosha which may not always be useful<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>2. Doing a Kumbh Vivah ceremony which requires native to marry a tree or idol of Vishnu before actual marriage. This practise may or may not give desired results. It is advised to only proceed if you have faith in this ceremony otherwise not to do if you feel it is superstitious and waste of time.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>3. Fasting from first tuesday of a month based on lunar calendar. This helps greatly especially if no salt is consumed on tuesday and less salt is consumed on other days. Reduction in sodium and potassium level not only reduces blood pressure but it also reduces excessive energy and fiery emotions in natives with a Mangal Dosha<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>4. Donating blood once every three month. While this solution has no scientific or religious validity associated it is not a bad idea just for the sake of blood donation drive to prosper. It doesn''t harm an individual if blood is donated and it also helps the society.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>5. Worship Hanuman, reciting Sunder Kand and visiting Hanuman temples. This helps greatly cause Lord Hanuman is lord of wisdom. He has strength and courage but is humble and submissive at the same time. This trait is subconsiously cultiaved in native by prayers to Lord Hanuman.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal Dosha is not as troublesome issue for marriage as it is made out to be. All it requires is to be aware of it if indeed present in horoscope and if this dosha is not cancelled by other factors. Even if you don''t give a damn about Mangal Dosha it is worth to note that anger, too much sex and harsh speech can destroy any relationship and careful consideration needs to be given not to cross your limit in a relationship.&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"20","created":"2014-03-24 07:33:41","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-24 07:48:40","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-24 07:48:32","publish_up":"2014-03-24 06:34:05","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":8,"ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

There are a couple of odd superstitions related with Shani. It is a human tendency to feel anger, anguish and fear of things which we do not comprehend. But it is necessary to understand the cause of fear and worries to get a solution in life. Here are a couple of superstitions commonly associated with Shani which are dispelled through adequate reasoning. Furthermore the activities done or suggested to pacify Shani are also properly analyzed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong style=\\"font-size: 1em;\\">Superstition 1: Shani Saade Saati is always bad<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This is the most unwarranted fear I''ve come across. As soon as a Saade-Saati starts people start to think that the next seven and half years of life would be hell. Some smart ones refer to an astrologer and decipher the effects of all 3 phases of two and half period to know which is the worst and which is favorable for them. Even the Jyotish instills unnecessary fear in the native and gives them wrong message.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani Saade Saati is an excellent time to burn past life karma be it good or bad. It only gives back what you''ve given in the past life and this life before the Saade Saati began. Depending on your karma all 3 subperiods could be good like heaven or bad like hell. So just think of doing good karma and eventually nothing bad would happen. Ofcourse progress is stalled but that doesn''t mean you don''t get the fruits of your hard work ever.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 2: Harsh Times go away by offering Oil to Shani and Lord Hanuman Idols<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>This is another crazy theory propogated by astrologers and priest alike. Obviously they would make a fortune out of it so they would love to see more and more people coming to offer oil. Imagine a temple where everyone offers 100 ml of oil to the idols. Say 300 people come to the temple out of which 200 pour oil on the idol. That equates to 20 litre of oil being wasted on a Saturday alone. That are rough statistics for one temple. Say in India and abroad there are atleast 1000 temples of Lord Hanuman &amp; Shani. So Saturday amounts for 20,000 litres of oil wastage due to a stupid superstition. That oil could have been used to feed the poor, export to other countries or even cook for oneself (after all God resides in each and every soul)<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani is the karaka for Scarcity, Famine and Drought. Imagine you go to Sahara Desert and waste water in front of the native who resides there. You can imagine how angry he would be cause he has to struggle to get drinking water. Same way I can only imagine how mad Mr. Grandpa Shani would be by wastage of oil on idols. It is better to donate oil to a poor cause Shani is also a karaka for Poverty.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4><strong>Superstition 3: Shani Chalisa and Shani Prayers are needed to calm the effects of furious Shani<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>I''ve seen people do religious mantra, superstitious activities and speak prayers of God and Gramps Shani all day long. While I am not against prayers of God, prayers to planet are not right in my opinion. They are just planets who follow a fix trajectory. They won''t change their trajectory for anyone. So why bother appeasing them?<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani couldn''t care less about appeasement cause he is a judge of people''s karma and he has to stay impartial and deliver due justice to the native. It doesn''t matter to him if you are a King or Servant, Rich or Poor, Religious or Non-Believer. I would suggest prayers to your favorite Gods once and to keep calm and continue to do your duties. That would be like a mercy plea in front of Judge Shani and he would oblidge and give mercy for sure.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 4: Shani drishti is always bad<\\/strong><\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>These might not be totally false cause even the literatures on Shani propogate this theory. But what they also describe is Shani is the judge of one''s karma.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reality: Shani gives results of past lives karma and that maybe an accumulation of many lives. Unless a native has done horrendous acts in his\\/her past lives it is not possible that horoscope houses which are aspected by Shani at birthtime keep on giving continuous bad results. What is necessary to know is Shani gives good or bad results to each house its transits or aspects when it moves in a Gochara Transit.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In the end all I want to say is don''t fret about Shani like he is some relentless stalker or merciless killer. Just keep calm through periods of Shani and try to do your karma as effectively as you can.

In a way sickness is a reminder by the body to a person that I am present and I need care and attention.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From an astrological perspective the <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10:tanu-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=114\\">1st house<\\/a> and lord of 1st house (Lagnesha or Ascendant) is responsible for the physical build and mental thought process.

It is interesting to note that 6th house also governs Debt and Enemies while 8th house governs Death. A sick man cannot fight Debts or Enemies neither can he escape Death. While a person''s physique and mental balance is down to destiny or past karma his health is in his own hands. A person can know about his physical and mental capabilities and diseases that occur frequently through the 1st House.

Any sort of association of 6th and 8th house or their lords signals a lengthy time span of a disease. Different planets, bhavas and rashi''s control different parts of body. Careful consideration needs to be given to every aspect before judging health and vitality of a native.

While only the sick (especially those who can''t find cures) seek astrology for guidance it is not a bad idea to look into a horoscope and find the most likely disease a body can be affected with. This can ascertain preventive measures to be taken before there is sickness.

Visha means Poison and this yoga can act as poison in life of individual. This yoga generally occurs every 27 days as it takes 27 days for moon to complete its rotation of earth and navigate via the 12 Rashis in a horoscope. While this yoga is catastrophic for most, it has been shown that a few natives do rise above this bad placement and do wonders in their respective fields. Visha Yoga is also called as Nitrubhasha Yoga or Shani-Chandra yoga.&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The very name Visha Yoga is enough to send jitters down the spine of many. If the angle between Shani and Chandra is less then 12 degrees than it is rest assured that these yoga would show you hell on earth. Imagine yourself being assigned to a prison where you are bound by chains and there is is a stern and relentless warden who beats with a whip at the slightest mistake. If you imagine the pain, fear and trauma you are close to understanding what Vish Yoga natives feel inside their head. Abeit it is the mind of the natives which makes a mountain out of mole hill but the trauma experienced is similar to lifetime sentence in a dark, lonely prison. &amp;nbsp;However Vedic Astrology is a classic case of paradox. What is written is quite opposite of what is observed. Many Vish Yoga natives are quite successful in life and can even be great contributors to the society. However what is largely observed is these natives get very low returns for the substantial amount of efforts put in. Unless they work very hard it is difficult for them to achieve anything in life.&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;To understand Vish Yoga well we need to understand the characteristics of the two planets which form the Vish Yoga. Shani known as Saturn is made up of poisonous gases among other substances. Chandra known as Moon is responsible for causing tides and ebbs in the ocean as well as liquid substance in body. In astrology Chandra is the karaka for mind. Shani poisons the mind of a native so the term &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\\"color: #000000;\\"&gt;Vish Yoga&lt;\\/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\\/strong&gt;is used. Digging deeper into the subject. Shani is the karaka for fear, oppression, scarcity, povery and hard work while Chandra is the karaka for emotions, unrequited love, affection and mother. Both of the planets are polar opposites in terms of personality and characteristics. When these two opposing planets combine in a horoscope they tend to constantly collide with each other on matters of ideologies. The mind of the native cannot make up whether he should guide his emotions or let emotions guide him. Naturally what follows is depression and despair- a typical trait of Vish Yoga natives.&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The picture is far more gloomy cause they may even become paranoid incapable of trusting others or believing in power of love. They are always physically tired and mentally exhausted. Often they attempt suicide but Shani would not let them take an escape route. Ofcourse some poor souls do use that option but that road is ill-advised for Vish Yoga natives.&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Shani is a cruel planet and association with karaka of mind makes the mind become cruel as well. Many dicatator and oppressors have Vish Yoga in their horoscope. These yoga also creates an emotional oppressor and such natives have often been observed to oppress others or give pain and despair to others. If &lt;a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=3:mangal&amp;amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;amp;Itemid=109\\"&gt;Mangal&lt;\\/a&gt; is associated they may actually derive happiness from torturing and harassing others. If Guru is involved they could actually help others instead of harming and practise empathy.&amp;nbsp;Vish Yoga natives are quite harsh in speech. If Mangal is associated with Shani-Chandra placement then natives are observed to be sarcastic also. However if a benefic &lt;a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=5:guru&amp;amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;amp;Itemid=109\\"&gt;Guru&lt;\\/a&gt; is aspecting the house where Shani-Chandra placement occurs then effects are neutralized. If &lt;a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=8:rahu&amp;amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;amp;Itemid=109\\"&gt;Rahu&lt;\\/a&gt; is present with Shani+Chandra then the effects are greatly increased and there is no way for native to recover. Generally any sort of association of Chandra, Shani and Rahu via aspect or placement suggests a life which is result of very bad karmas in past lives. &amp;nbsp;&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;So how to tackle this difficult placement? It is not at all easy. Whether to choose mandate of duties and responsibilties given by Shani or whether to go with emotions, love and care bestowed by Chandra.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;Solution: Get your horoscope analyzed by an astrologer. If Vish Yoga is in a friendly rashi or exaltion rashi of Chandra then go with emotions otherwise all other scenarios go for duties and responsibilities of Shani. As long as you take one of the path rest all should work out fine. No matter which path you take you would require concrete efforts (Shani) to get your objective. So whether you are looking to help the world (Chandra) or bend the world (Shani) you need to focus on that objective. Do not dwell too much on other things and you are bound to end up as success in life.&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;Remedies: All solutions for Vish Yoga are useless without prayers to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is the remover of darkness and negativity, the drinker of poison and God of Knowledge. Recitation of ''Om Namah Shivay'' specifically in evening and night is advised when moon is present. Also prayers to Lord Jesus or Lord Vishnu or any of his avatar are advised. They are gods of compassion and love. They teach to love and help mankind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\\/p&gt;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"14","created":"2014-03-24 11:10:58","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-24 10:14:40","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-24 10:10:59","publish_up":"2014-03-24 10:14:40","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"0","metakey":"visha yoga, paapa kartari yogas, shani chandra yoga, nitrubhasha yoga","metadesc":"vish yoga description","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

But for NBRY to occur a fundamental law is that the concerned person has to see humiliation and defeat in early part of life so much so that most of those around him start to question the native''s credentials.

He starts to see things differently and sooner or later starts to find the ingredients which make him successful and renowned. Ofcourse to the outsiders who questioned him can never imagine that such a worthless scum could achieve unparalleled success so they merely pass it off as Got Lucky but for the native the story is different. He knows the hard work, sweat, patience and noble intentions he had to cultivate to reach that place among elites.

In other words Neecha Bhanga leads person to lead a normal or above normal existence but does not have the capacity to turn a beggar into a king.

So if you are still restricted to personal well-being you are not ready to get the NBRY in your horoscope even if present. After all it is not easy to care for others who hurt you and make fun of you. When you learn to accept criticism with dignity and achieve patience, hope, faith and humility is the time when NBRY gives full fruit.

But later in modern astrology these yogas have gained prominence. Vipreeta Raja Yoga (VRY) is a yoga formed when the lord of dushamsthanas are located in dushamsthanas. There are a host of rules for occurence or cancellation of these yoga which are discussed in details in this article.&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The first and foremost thing to understand is Vipreeta Raja Yoga is essentially a dushamsthana planet in a dushamsthana placement. In mathamatics two negatives always result in positive but in astrology it is not always the case though astrology is highly influenced by mathematics. Even if VRY occurs in life it actually take time before it gives fruition just like NBRY. Normally period of 36-42 years may already have passed before the circumstances turn Vipreeta or opposite to past and current bad scenario. Life is always ready to provide opportunities to individuals but the &lt;a title=\\"Prarabdha Article\\" href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=81:prarabdha&amp;amp;catid=41:main-articles\\"&gt;Prarabdha&lt;\\/a&gt; determines whether the concerned native would make the most of ray of hope provided or let it pass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;First we would look at the various types of Vipreeta Raja Yoga&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;1. Harsh Yoga: When lord of 12th house is in 6th house then Harsha Yoga is said to be formed. Some text mention lord of any dushamsthana house in 6th house gives rise to Harsh Yoga. This yoga makes a person fortunate, happy, invincible, strong, sturdy, wealthy and famous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;2. Sarala Yoga: When lord of 8th house is located in 8th house then Sarala Yoga is formed. Some text say lord of any dushamsthana houses in 8th house causes Sarala Yoga. This yoga makes a person long-lived, fearless, happy, invincible, learned, a terror to his enemies, wealthy, famous, celebrated and prosperous.&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;3. Vimala Yoga: When lord of the 6th house occupies the 12th house, Vimala Yoga is formed. Some text say lord of any dushamstahana in 12th house causes Vimala Yoga. This yoga makes a person independent, endowed with noble qualities, wealthy, happy and economical in spending.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;There are rules of cancellation of VRY which are mentioned below.&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;1. The lord of Dushamsthana Houses is also a lord of Laxmi Sthanas&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;2. When there is Parivartana Yoga between any of the Dushamsthana House Lords.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;3. Lords of 10th house or Laxmi Sthanas should not be present in the dushamsthana house where VRY occurs. For example: For Mithuna Lagna lord of house 6 is Mangal. If Mangal is located in 12th house then Vimala Yoga is formed. But if Guru or Budh is also present with Mangal in 12th house then the result of VRY won''t be obtained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\\/p&gt;<br \\/>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Vipreeta Raja Yogas are too difficult to judge just like &lt;a title=\\"Neech Bhanga Raja Yoga Link\\" href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=83:neech-bhanga&amp;amp;catid=13:imp-yogas&amp;amp;Itemid=113\\"&gt;NBRY&lt;\\/a&gt;. Countless permutations and combinations have to be deciphered before coming to the right conclusion. What is generally observed is most of natives with a dushamsthana lord in dushamstha house are presented with some sort of help against the flow of circumstances. Some take that helping hand and do wonders in their life while others keep on looking for all the lights to turn green and they never do turn green. If you have a dushamsthana planet in a dushamsthana location the best thing to do is keep calm and work towards a fixed goal. When there is an opportunity presented that same calmness and previous efforts would give fruitful results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\\/p&gt;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"14","created":"2014-03-24 11:19:43","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-24 10:21:21","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-24 10:19:44","publish_up":"2014-03-24 10:21:21","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":2,"ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0);

Focus on helping elderly and things would work out just fine.&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"14","created":"2014-03-24 11:22:09","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-24 10:23:49","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-24 10:22:32","publish_up":"2014-03-24 10:22:32","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"0","metakey":"guru chandra yoga, vipra chandal yoga, guru chandal yoga, guru+rahu","metadesc":"guru chandal yoga description","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Visha means Poison and this yoga can act as poison in life of individual. This yoga generally occurs every 27 days as it takes 27 days for moon to complete its rotation of earth and navigate via the 12 Rashis in a horoscope. While this yoga is catastrophic for most, it has been shown that a few natives do rise above this bad placement and do wonders in their respective fields. Visha Yoga is also called as Nitrubhasha Yoga or Shani-Chandra yoga.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The very name Visha Yoga is enough to send jitters down the spine of many. If the angle between Shani and Chandra is less then 12 degrees than it is rest assured that these yoga would show you hell on earth. Imagine yourself being assigned to a prison where you are bound by chains and there is is a stern and relentless warden who beats with a whip at the slightest mistake. If you imagine the pain, fear and trauma you are close to understanding what Vish Yoga natives feel inside their head. Abeit it is the mind of the natives which makes a mountain out of mole hill but the trauma experienced is similar to lifetime sentence in a dark, lonely prison. &nbsp;However Vedic Astrology is a classic case of paradox. What is written is quite opposite of what is observed. Many Vish Yoga natives are quite successful in life and can even be great contributors to the society. However what is largely observed is these natives get very low returns for the substantial amount of efforts put in. Unless they work very hard it is difficult for them to achieve anything in life.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To understand Vish Yoga well we need to understand the characteristics of the two planets which form the Vish Yoga. Shani known as Saturn is made up of poisonous gases among other substances. Chandra known as Moon is responsible for causing tides and ebbs in the ocean as well as liquid substance in body. In astrology Chandra is the karaka for mind. Shani poisons the mind of a native so the term <strong><span style=\\"color: #000000;\\">Vish Yoga<\\/span>&nbsp;<\\/strong>is used. Digging deeper into the subject. Shani is the karaka for fear, oppression, scarcity, povery and hard work while Chandra is the karaka for emotions, unrequited love, affection and mother. Both of the planets are polar opposites in terms of personality and characteristics. When these two opposing planets combine in a horoscope they tend to constantly collide with each other on matters of ideologies. The mind of the native cannot make up whether he should guide his emotions or let emotions guide him. Naturally what follows is depression and despair- a typical trait of Vish Yoga natives.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The picture is far more gloomy cause they may even become paranoid incapable of trusting others or believing in power of love. They are always physically tired and mentally exhausted. Often they attempt suicide but Shani would not let them take an escape route. Ofcourse some poor souls do use that option but that road is ill-advised for Vish Yoga natives.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shani is a cruel planet and association with karaka of mind makes the mind become cruel as well. Many dicatator and oppressors have Vish Yoga in their horoscope. These yoga also creates an emotional oppressor and such natives have often been observed to oppress others or give pain and despair to others. If <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Mangal<\\/a> is associated they may actually derive happiness from torturing and harassing others. If Guru is involved they could actually help others instead of harming and practise empathy.&nbsp;Vish Yoga natives are quite harsh in speech. If Mangal is associated with Shani-Chandra placement then natives are observed to be sarcastic also. However if a benefic <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Guru<\\/a> is aspecting the house where Shani-Chandra placement occurs then effects are neutralized. If <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=9:9-planets&amp;Itemid=109\\">Rahu<\\/a> is present with Shani+Chandra then the effects are greatly increased and there is no way for native to recover. Generally any sort of association of Chandra, Shani and Rahu via aspect or placement suggests a life which is result of very bad karmas in past lives. &nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So how to tackle this difficult placement? It is not at all easy. Whether to choose mandate of duties and responsibilties given by Shani or whether to go with emotions, love and care bestowed by Chandra.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Solution: Get your horoscope analyzed by an astrologer. If Vish Yoga is in a friendly rashi or exaltion rashi of Chandra then go with emotions otherwise all other scenarios go for duties and responsibilities of Shani. As long as you take one of the path rest all should work out fine. No matter which path you take you would require concrete efforts (Shani) to get your objective. So whether you are looking to help the world (Chandra) or bend the world (Shani) you need to focus on that objective. Do not dwell too much on other things and you are bound to end up as success in life.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Remedies: All solutions for Vish Yoga are useless without prayers to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is the remover of darkness and negativity, the drinker of poison and God of Knowledge. Recitation of ''Om Namah Shivay'' specifically in evening and night is advised when moon is present. Also prayers to Lord Jesus or Lord Vishnu or any of his avatar are advised. They are gods of compassion and love. They teach to love and help mankind.&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"14","created":"2014-03-24 11:10:58","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-24 10:48:18","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-24 10:47:41","publish_up":"2014-03-24 10:14:40","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":6,"ordering":"0","metakey":"visha yoga, paapa kartari yogas, shani chandra yoga, nitrubhasha yoga","metadesc":"vish yoga description","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

But later in modern astrology these yogas have gained prominence. Vipreeta Raja Yoga (VRY) is a yoga formed when the lord of dushamsthanas are located in dushamsthanas. There are a host of rules for occurence or cancellation of these yoga which are discussed in details in this article.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first and foremost thing to understand is Vipreeta Raja Yoga is essentially a dushamsthana planet in a dushamsthana placement. In mathamatics two negatives always result in positive but in astrology it is not always the case though astrology is highly influenced by mathematics. Even if VRY occurs in life it actually take time before it gives fruition just like NBRY. Normally period of 36-42 years may already have passed before the circumstances turn Vipreeta or opposite to past and current bad scenario. Life is always ready to provide opportunities to individuals but the <a title=\\"Prarabdha Article\\" href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81:prarabdha&amp;catid=41:main-articles\\">Prarabdha<\\/a> determines whether the concerned native would make the most of ray of hope provided or let it pass.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>First we would look at the various types of Vipreeta Raja Yoga<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>1. Harsh Yoga: When lord of 12th house is in 6th house then Harsha Yoga is said to be formed. Some text mention lord of any dushamsthana house in 6th house gives rise to Harsh Yoga. This yoga makes a person fortunate, happy, invincible, strong, sturdy, wealthy and famous.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>2. Sarala Yoga: When lord of 8th house is located in 8th house then Sarala Yoga is formed. Some text say lord of any dushamsthana houses in 8th house causes Sarala Yoga. This yoga makes a person long-lived, fearless, happy, invincible, learned, a terror to his enemies, wealthy, famous, celebrated and prosperous.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>3. Vimala Yoga: When lord of the 6th house occupies the 12th house, Vimala Yoga is formed. Some text say lord of any dushamstahana in 12th house causes Vimala Yoga. This yoga makes a person independent, endowed with noble qualities, wealthy, happy and economical in spending.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>There are rules of cancellation of VRY which are mentioned below.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>1. The lord of Dushamsthana Houses is also a lord of Laxmi Sthanas<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>2. When there is Parivartana Yoga between any of the Dushamsthana House Lords.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>3. Lords of 10th house or Laxmi Sthanas should not be present in the dushamsthana house where VRY occurs. For example: For Mithuna Lagna lord of house 6 is Mangal. If Mangal is located in 12th house then Vimala Yoga is formed. But if Guru or Budh is also present with Mangal in 12th house then the result of VRY won''t be obtained.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vipreeta Raja Yogas are too difficult to judge just like <a title=\\"Neech Bhanga Raja Yoga Link\\" href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83:neech-bhanga&amp;catid=13:imp-yogas&amp;Itemid=113\\">NBRY<\\/a>. Countless permutations and combinations have to be deciphered before coming to the right conclusion. What is generally observed is most of natives with a dushamsthana lord in dushamstha house are presented with some sort of help against the flow of circumstances. Some take that helping hand and do wonders in their life while others keep on looking for all the lights to turn green and they never do turn green. If you have a dushamsthana planet in a dushamsthana location the best thing to do is keep calm and work towards a fixed goal. When there is an opportunity presented that same calmness and previous efforts would give fruitful results.&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"14","created":"2014-03-24 11:19:43","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-24 10:49:18","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-24 10:49:02","publish_up":"2014-03-24 10:21:21","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

It was later propogated by new age astrologers through case studies and experience. However what has largely been observed is there are valid reasons to believe that such yoga occurs in a horoscope. Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga is best explained by the story <a href=\\"http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/The_Frog_Prince_(story)\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Frog Prince<\\/a> written by Grimm Brothers. Nothing in this world inspires people more then the underdog who fights all odds and wins. Rags to Riches story is an inspiration for all people who dream of similar fate.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; NBRY in simple terms is a yoga which leads an underdog to perform above average deeds and acts. But for NBRY to occur a fundamental law is that the concerned person has to see humiliation and defeat in early part of life so much so that most of those around him start to question the native''s credentials. But these same humiliations and defeats are slowly but surely building the character of native. He starts to see things differently and sooner or later starts to find the ingredients which make him successful and renowned. Ofcourse to the outsiders who questioned him can never imagine that such a worthless scum could achieve unparalleled success so they merely pass it off as Got Lucky but for the native the story is different. He knows the hard work, sweat, patience and noble intentions he had to cultivate to reach that place among elites. In a way it can be said that the Neecha characteristics of the planet never goes away and such natives inspite of their position in life are always questioned by those around.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neecha Bhanga has some rules which are needed for its cancellation of neecha chracteristics. Some primary factors are mentioned below:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Neecha planet occupies the Vishnu Sthana or Laxmi Sthana from the Lagna or Chandra counted as Lagna.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>One of the co-tenants along with the neecha planet is an uccha planet or lord of the rashi (for eg.

Retrograde Budh in Meena produces NBRY if Guru is located in Karka and native has Meena Lagna).&nbsp;<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>If the ruler of rashi of neecha planet is in kendra and in an uccha sthana or own rashi &nbsp;(for eg. Shani in Mesha would cause neecha bhanga if Mangal is in Makara)<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>If the neecha planet is located in an uccha navamsha in Vishnu or Laxmi Sthana<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>If the neecha planet has good Ashtvarga strength.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These are rough points and really there is actually a lot more to the equation. The term ''Neecha Bhanga'' actually differs from the term ''NBRY''. Neecha Bhanga is just the cancellation of neecha characteristics. In other words Neecha Bhanga leads person to lead a normal or above normal existence but does not have the capacity to turn a beggar into a king. Many people see Neecha Bhanga in their life cause one of the above equations is possible to be present in the horoscope. But NBRY has that capacity to turn dirt into gold. That rarely happens in my humble opinion.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One way to know about NBRY is to check the above mentioned points for NBRY particularly the first four points, Afterwards try to honestly answer if you have found your higher purpose in life. As crazy as it sounds people with NBRY tend to live a life devoted to a fixed purpose and that purpose generally involves well-being of others. So if you are still restricted to personal well-being you are not ready to get the NBRY in your horoscope even if present. After all it is not easy to care for others who hurt you and make fun of you. When you learn to accept criticism with dignity and achieve patience, hope, faith and humility is the time when NBRY gives full fruit. More important then that is your purpose to do something in life which would benefit others. At that time even the Gods would bend down and give respect so how can planets be an exception.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"14","created":"2014-03-24 11:16:05","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-24 10:50:17","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-24 10:49:54","publish_up":"2014-03-24 10:16:35","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":4,"ordering":"0","metakey":"neecha bhanga, neech bhang, neech bhanga, yogas for elevation","metadesc":"neech bhanga raja yoga description","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),

Some people are highly negative and consult astrologers to find out the right time to eat and sleep. What I personally advise is to learn about your Purushartha or goal of your life from astrologers as nothing is wrong in that. After that only visit him in times of calamity for solutions if possible through astrology. An honest astrologer is sure to give you right advise about the right course of action to take.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally don''t lose hope when all is lost and don''t get over the moon when you gain everything you''ve set out to do.

Vedic Astrology and Vedic Texts suggest trying hard (Purushartha) for matters of Dharma Houses (<a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10:tanu-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=114\\">1st house<\\/a>, <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14:putra-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110\\">5th house<\\/a> and <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18:bhagya-sthana&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110\\">9th house<\\/a>) as well as Moksha Houses (<a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13:matru-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110\\">4th house<\\/a>, <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17:mrityu-sthana&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110\\">8th house<\\/a> and <a href=\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=21:vyaya-bhava&amp;catid=10:12-houses&amp;Itemid=110\\">12th house<\\/a>). To be more precise one should try hard for a good character, good health, good education, being religious as well try hard to get peace and happiness, think of death and rebirths and also work towards minimizing losses as well as gaining liberation from cycle of life and death by attaining Moksha.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Astrologers are generally not sought until situation is worse and all hope is lost. Some people are highly negative and consult astrologers to find out the right time to eat and sleep. What I personally advise is to learn about your Purushartha or goal of your life from astrologers as nothing is wrong in that. After that only visit him in times of calamity for solutions if possible through astrology. An honest astrologer is sure to give you right advise about the right course of action to take.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally don''t lose hope when all is lost and don''t get over the moon when you gain everything you''ve set out to do. Both are temperory. Your actions are permanent. So stick to your Purushartha and learn to enjoy the Prarabdha which has befallen you whether it is good or bad.&nbsp;<\\/p>","fulltext":"","state":1,"catid":"19","created":"2014-03-25 12:38:56","created_by":"899","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-03-25 11:40:22","modified_by":"899","checked_out":"899","checked_out_time":"2014-03-25 11:39:45","publish_up":"2014-03-25 11:39:45","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\\"image_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"float_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_intro_caption\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"float_fulltext\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_alt\\":\\"\\",\\"image_fulltext_caption\\":\\"\\"}","urls":"{\\"urla\\":false,\\"urlatext\\":\\"\\",\\"targeta\\":\\"\\",\\"urlb\\":false,\\"urlbtext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetb\\":\\"\\",\\"urlc\\":false,\\"urlctext\\":\\"\\",\\"targetc\\":\\"\\"}","attribs":"{\\"show_title\\":\\"\\",\\"link_titles\\":\\"\\",\\"show_tags\\":\\"\\",\\"show_intro\\":\\"\\",\\"info_block_position\\":\\"\\",\\"show_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"link_parent_category\\":\\"\\",\\"show_author\\":\\"\\",\\"link_author\\":\\"\\",\\"show_create_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_modify_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publish_date\\":\\"\\",\\"show_item_navigation\\":\\"\\",\\"show_icons\\":\\"\\",\\"show_print_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_email_icon\\":\\"\\",\\"show_vote\\":\\"\\",\\"show_hits\\":\\"\\",\\"show_noauth\\":\\"\\",\\"urls_position\\":\\"\\",\\"alternative_readmore\\":\\"\\",\\"article_layout\\":\\"\\",\\"show_publishing_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_article_options\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_backend\\":\\"\\",\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\":\\"\\"}","version":3,"ordering":"0","metakey":"purushartha, hard work in astrology, learn vedic astrology, vedic astrology tutorials","metadesc":"purushartha in vedic astrology","access":"1","hits":"0","metadata":"{\\"robots\\":\\"\\",\\"author\\":\\"\\",\\"rights\\":\\"\\",\\"xreference\\":\\"\\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":""}', 0),
